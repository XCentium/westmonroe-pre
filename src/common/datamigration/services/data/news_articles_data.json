It targets financial and operational efficiency, promising 20-30% savings in IT spend for both payers and providers. By optimizing operational processes and leveraging technology, including generative AI, healthcare organizations can expect significant reductions in operational costs and improved margins. This offering builds on the firm&rsquo;s previous successes in this area: Last year West Monroe optimized one healthcare provider&rsquo;s IT operating model and talent strategy that led to more than <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=AFA6F58A8C664208A2E2A5273F0EE2AB&amp;_z=z\">$400 million in savings</a>.&nbsp;<br />\n    <br />\n    <strong></strong></li>\n    <li><strong>Data-Driven Healthcare Transformation:&nbsp;</strong>This offering enables healthcare organizations to discover and leverage hidden value in their data. Using advanced analytics, data monetization, and generative AI, they can tackle key challenges such as post-COVID adaptation, workforce shortages, and financial constraints by setting up AI governance, identifying valuable data use cases, and creating new revenue streams. The approach is designed for healthcare payers and providers aiming to improve healthcare outcomes, operational efficiency, and financial health. With a focus on rapid value identification and realization with investments in AI and data capabilities, this offering helps healthcare organizations maximize the impact of their data assets for innovation and growth while also navigating the complexities of today&rsquo;s healthcare ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n    <br />\n    </li>\n    <li><strong><a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=432AC9E40A8F437EB0809F570B673D91&amp;_z=z\">Medicare Star Rating Optimization</a>:</strong> Aimed at health payers, this offering helps payers start now to adapt to the data needs and calculation requirements that will come with the star rating changes&mdash;which will be replaced by a new system that incorporates the Health Equality Index. By gaining visibility into data gaps and potential risk now, health payers can avoid the loss of a 1-star reduction which can lead to a 13.4-17.6% decrease in revenue and an 8-12% loss in enrollment growth year over year.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=4F04480604704525A46B8D4156182EE8&amp;_z=z\">Larry Briski</a>, leader of the healthcare sector at West Monroe over the payer and provider sectors, highlights the comprehensive approach of these offerings.&ldquo;Our multidisciplinary approach combining healthcare expertise with technology, data, operations, IT strategy, and people &amp; organization expertise takes a holistic approach to these pressing healthcare issues&mdash;a tested path to enduring results,&rdquo; Briski said.</p>",

					"content": "<p>West Monroe Partners, a full-service business and technology consultancy, announced today the findings from its latest study of supply chain executives that was conducted in partnership with Loyola University&rsquo;s Supply and Value Chain Center and BearingPoint. The study found that more than half of North American supply chain executives currently consider developing a sustainable supply chain as a strategic priority.<br />\n<br />\nThe study also found that of companies that plan to implement sustainability initiatives, improved competitive advantage and brand image are the key motivators. According to West Monroe&rsquo;s study, 36 percent of companies have plans to incorporate sustainability into their operations and 22 percent of that group plan to do so in the next one to three years.<br />\n<br />\nLast year, West Monroe conducted a sustainability survey amongst North American consumers and found that more than half of consumers are willing to pay at least 5 percent higher prices for products ordered online if they&rsquo;re delivered sustainably, and 76 percent would wait at least one extra day for climate-friendly transport. European consumers shared a similar willingness to wait longer and slightly more tolerance for higher prices, according to the equivalent survey conducted by BearingPoint. Given these findings, it&rsquo;s surprising that more companies aren&rsquo;t making sustainability a strategic priority.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s telling that more companies aren&rsquo;t implementing sustainable business practices in their operations given the demands of customers,&rdquo; said Yves Leclerc, managing director at West Monroe. &ldquo;Most supply chain teams are struggling to manage the complexities of globalization, the war for talent and increasing demands so allocating budget and resources towards sustainability doesn&rsquo;t seem feasible unless companies can put together a business case for the return on the investment.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nWest Monroe, Loyola University Chicago and BearingPoint sought to better understand how North American companies are incorporating sustainable business practices into their operations. To further the analysis, the North American survey&rsquo;s results were compared against a survey conducted by West Monroe&rsquo;s global alliance partner, BearingPoint. In Europe, 59 percent of companies surveyed stated that developing a sustainable supply chain is already a strategic priority. <br />\n<br />\nSimilar to North American respondents, European supply chain executives also cite brand image improvement as the most important motivator. Innovation was far less important in European respondents than in North American respondents (36 percent versus 47 percent). Dissimilar to North American respondents, European supply chain executives placed the highest importance on the economic impacts of sustainability whereas North American executives prioritized environmental impact.<br />\n<br />\nWest Monroe joined the Loyola Supply and Value Chain Center, a group of supply chain professionals working to improve global supply chain management and sustainability, in June of 2014. <br />\n<br />\nA copy of the full survey results can be found <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=55632E52B6DC483D84BCE603B3758A42&amp;_z=z\">here</a>.<br />\n<br />\n</p>\n<h2>About West Monroe<strong> </strong></h2>\n<p>\nWest Monroe is a progressive business and technology consulting firm that partners with dynamic organizations to reimagine, build, and operate their businesses at peak performance.

					"content": "<p>Jan. 24, 2018 (SAN ANTONIO) &ndash; Differences between U.S. utility executives and managers may be creating a cultural rift that could impede utilities&rsquo; ability to integrate information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) &ndash; a critical step in many utilities&rsquo; path to grid modernization. And, cybersecurity is the top concern on everyone&rsquo;s minds &ndash; both around the risk associated with integrated systems and insufficient expertise within the utility work force. These are among the key findings from new research released today at DistribuTECH by West Monroe Partners, a national business and technology consultancy.</p>\n<p>\nIndustry survey results highlight challenges utilities face as they modernize. The findings provide valuable insight into how utilities are managing the integration of IT and OT, and where they should focus to advance their strategies. More than 140 U.S. utility professionals, representing a range of utility types, services, and sizes, completed the survey in late 2017.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe full research paper, <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.westmonroe.com/Insights/White-Papers/Managing-Grid-Modernization\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Managing Grid Modernization: Integrating IT and Operations at U.S. Utilities,&rdquo;</a> is being shared at DistribuTECH, the leading annual electric power transmission and distribution conference, Jan. 23-25, 2018. It is also available for free download on West Monroe&rsquo;s website.<br />\n<br />\nSuccessful grid modernization requires strengthened organizational structures and change management &ndash; yet the survey results point to gaps in culture, priorities, and expectations between C-suite executives motivated to move their organizations into the future and managers focused on current operations.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;It is not unusual for large organizations to experience a disconnect between the C-suite and managers. This is especially true for large investor-owned utilities that are grappling with distinct organizations spread across a large geographical area or even across multiple states,&rdquo; said Daniel Belmont, senior director in West Monroe's Energy &amp; Utilities practice. &ldquo;To make meaningful progress with grid modernization, utility executives must be aware of this gap and, more importantly, understand how to close it.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nThe survey also explored concerns that may be limiting progress around IT/OT integration. Among the various issues studied &ndash; which ranged from governance of devices and systems to retraining staff &ndash; cybersecurity was far and away the leading concern and a key reason utilities are moving cautiously on technology integration. Two-thirds of respondents cited cybersecurity systems and devices as a top concern for managing converged IT/OT systems. Moreover, a majority (55 percent) said cybersecurity/NERC-CIP was the top skill or certification lacking in their workforce.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;In addition to the usual headaches accompanying a service disruption, a cyber-attack carries significant reputational risks, which may prompt heightened caution from leadership at investor-owned utilities,&rdquo; said Jodi Bednar, senior principal in the Energy &amp; Utilities practice. &ldquo;From our perspective, utilities are working on this issue, and the survey shows that they are acutely aware of the importance &ndash; but also the challenge &ndash; of bolstering cybersecurity skills.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nThe survey report also allows utility executives to compare their own progress in other areas critical to advancing grid modernization, including:&nbsp;\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p>The degree to which IT and operational teams share asset management, knowledge management, and ticketing systems&nbsp;</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>Current use of IT frameworks (including ITIL, COBIT, FCAPS, or eTOM) for managing the complexity associated with coordinating IT and OT operations&nbsp;</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>Prevalence of a &ldquo;single pane of glass&rdquo; to monitor and manage grid health</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nSurvey author Daniel Belmont is on-site at DistribuTECH discussing the survey results with utility executives and other attendees.

Brian is an established relationship builder, business developer, and people focused leader. &nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe firm&rsquo;s shift in office leadership will allow its founder Tom Bolger, to focus time and energy on the firm&rsquo;s strategic growth initiatives and accelerate the growth of existing offices and expansion of West Monroe&rsquo;s geographic footprint. Bolger will remain in the Seattle office and continue to oversee the firm&rsquo;s West Coast operations. The Seattle office, now in its 9th year, ended 2014 with more than 60 consultants. <br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thrilled that I have the opportunity to hand over the reins to one of the best leaders I&rsquo;ve known,&rdquo; said Tom Bolger, manager director of strategic growth.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have no doubt that Brian is going to lead the office to new heights and believe that we have never been better positioned for growth and continued development.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;I feel very privileged to have the amazing opportunity to lead our thriving team in Seattle,&rdquo; shared Paulen. &ldquo;We are experiencing growth, both in headcount and revenue, unlike any other time in our firm&rsquo;s history. I&rsquo;m very much looking forward to the challenge of continuing to build a unique culture and foundation that Tom Bolger established. I&rsquo;m eager to elevate the firm&rsquo;s momentum in the Seattle marketplace.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nPaulen joined West Monroe with its acquisition of Madrona Solutions Group, a Seattle-based consultancy he co-founded and ran as CEO in July 2005. The firm helped mid-market and enterprise-sized clients build customer relationship management solutions on the Dynamics CRM and Salesforce.com platforms. Under Paulen&rsquo;s leadership, Madrona Solutions Group was a very successful CRM and Analytics business which grew to approximately 35 employees over seven years. The firm repeatedly was recognized as one of the fastest growing private companies in Washington and received various &ldquo;Best Company to Work For&rdquo; awards.<br />\n<br />\nMoving forward, the Seattle office has plans to expand its team and capabilities into the next year and beyond.&nbsp; In 2015, the Seattle team is expecting to grow by more than 20 consultants and is focused on adding a Security and Compliance service line as well as Organizational Change Management services, both of which are existing overall firm focus areas. Additionally, to build on the firm&rsquo;s national strength in the retail sector, under Paulen&rsquo;s leadership the office will look to develop relationships with many of the Pacific Northwest&rsquo;s successful retailers.&nbsp; Beyond 2015, the office is expected to continue its aggressive growth by offering other strategic, efficiency driving solutions to customers. &nbsp;</p>",

					"content": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Survey of 700 C-suite execs and 5,000 consumers reveals digital progress, priorities</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em></em><span style=\"text-align: left;\">CHICAGO, August 9, 2022&mdash;West Monroe, one of the fastest-growing digital services firms, today announces the results of their inaugural <em><strong></strong></em> survey of companies across seven industries and 5,000 of their customers. The survey finds that organizations are well on their way to realizing their digital future, but still have opportunities to further enhance and align their vision, products, customer engagement, data, and people strategies&mdash;as well as the operational processes that connect them.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\nWhile a majority of the C-suite believes they&rsquo;ve built a compelling vision for a digital agility model, the stakes are high for companies amid a challenging economy and high customer expectations. To realize their digital vision, companies are focused on three major priorities: improving the customer experience (37%), enhancing their data capabilities (35%) and improving scalability through process improvement (32%).<br>\n<br>\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to say goodbye to the idea of digital transformation as a box to check. Clark Kent can walk into a phone booth and come out as Superman &ndash; but unless you&rsquo;re a superhero, that kind of transformation is unrealistic,&rdquo; says Matt Johnson, Managing Director in West Monroe&rsquo;s <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=E70C2020E557422D9E6566D2EADABA8C&amp;_z=z\">Product, Experience &amp; Engineering Lab</a>. &ldquo;Organizations don&rsquo;t need superpowers to evolve. They just need agility. It starts with a digital mindset and translates across every decision and department within the organization.&rdquo;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">\nAdditional Key Findings Include:</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Vision: </strong>Digital isn&rsquo;t something you do, it&rsquo;s something you are &ndash; a mindset &ndash; and companies are in the early stages of this transition. Nearly all (95%) report they have a clear sense of how digital fuels growth, but only 47% say they are very effective at having a digital mindset.</li>\n    <li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Products &amp; Experiences</strong>: Almost a majority organizations (49%) say they&rsquo;re very effecting at putting the consumer at the center of everything, but consumers reveal some misaligned priorities. For example, consumers care much more about simplicity and much less about personalization, access to guidance, and new digital products and services than companies think they do.</li>\n    <li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Data &amp; Technology: </strong>All organizations give themselves a passing grade for data maturity, but only 43% grade themselves an A, and others may be grading on a curve. For example, just over half have cloud-based data, IP and infrastructure, and only 50% use data as a catalyst for change. A vast majority of companies are investing to close both of those gaps.</li>\n    <li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Customer Engagement:</strong> Only 37% of companies grade their customer experience as an A, and consumers have made it clear that anything less than an A is a failure. Nearly two thirds of consumers (63%) say they will switch to another company if their experience is lacking.</li>\n    <li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Business Operations: </strong>With data capabilities a key goal, 47% of companies are also investing significantly to enable algorithmic decision-making, which can enable agility across the organization and allow for flexibility and speed in meeting consumer needs. Organizations are evolving quickly to a more iterative model, with 48% reporting they are very effective at prioritizing fast over perfect.</li>\n    <li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Organization &amp; People:</strong> Digital must be a team sport, but only 25% say their full C-suite is responsible for digital transformation. However, nearly half are investing significantly to help with employee enablement and to move to a more decentralized organizational design.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s encouraging to see companies recognize the importance of enabling data-driven decision-making and agile thinking. But there&rsquo;s more work ahead,&rdquo; says <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=138F7D55B5A14438A584D42C3EF948A4&amp;_z=z\">Casey Foss</a>, Chief Commercial Officer at West Monroe. &ldquo;With consumer expectations and preferences constantly changing, the key is access to real-time data and insights.&rdquo;<br>\n<br>\nFor more findings and to learn more about West Monroe&rsquo;s digital agility model, view the full Be Digital research <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=D1A93FA6F95348A19CB5361B9AC10390&amp;_z=z\">here</a>.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Be Digital Signature Research</strong><br>\n<em>Be Digital</em>, West Monroe&rsquo;s signature research initiative, polled 700 C-Suite executives across seven industries (financial services, healthcare providers, healthcare insurers, manufacturing, retail, technology and utilities) and more than 5,000 of their representative consumers.

					"content": "<p>WASHINGTON, D.C.&nbsp;&ndash; The U.S. Department of Energy should place a higher priority on developing an accurate and actionable inventory of agency-owned or managed properties that can be leased or sold for energy development, says a new <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24825/utilizing-the-energy-resource-potential-of-doe-lands\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The report recommends a sequence of activities DOE can follow to manage its lands and identify properties that have promising profiles for energy resource development. </p>\n<div id=\"radePasteHelper\" style=\"border: 0px solid red; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden; position: absolute;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<p>While other governmental agencies, such as the Department of the Interior, have examined and marketed opportunities to promote renewable resource development on public lands, DOE appears to have done much less, the report says. But with DOE&rsquo;s depth and breadth of skills and technical capabilities with energy resources, it too could leverage such opportunities and play a major role in forging private-public partnerships in land development serving the national interest. The agency has varying degrees of responsibility over 164 sites in 32 states.</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>&ldquo;The intersection of public benefit and private interest is strong on these lands, and their development can further the national objective of energy independence and greater national security,&rdquo; said Paul DeCotis, chair of the committee that wrote the report, and senior director of energy and utilities at West Monroe Partners, New York, N.Y. &ldquo;Development of such lands has the potential to turn idle properties into valuable income-generating assets. With the most cost-effective resources developed at the most appropriate sites, DOE lands can serve as a commercial and research hub for innovative energy technologies.&rdquo;</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>The committee was tasked with reviewing analyses, commissioned by DOE from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the Colorado School of Mines (CSM), of the potential for energy resource development on DOE-managed lands. The analyses themselves were constrained by limited data and budgets. To the extent that site-specific information was developed for the highest-scoring sites, the analysis provided insights on the energy resource types that have potential to be developed at those sites. Overall, the analyses did not settle the question of which sites have the greatest potential or which additional sites can be cost-effectively developed, the report says.&nbsp; </p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>The report concludes that the use of Levelized Cost of Electricity as the main determinant of the potential for energy resource development on DOE lands &ndash; as the NREL portion of the analyses did -- is a flawed approach. Site-specific analyses for individual technologies and resources are needed, because the unique circumstances of each individual project will determine an investor&rsquo;s decision to develop the project. The NREL analysis does identify sites for development and provides an indication of the resource(s) that might have development potential, but with limited confidence, the report notes.</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>The report recommends that DOE develop an accurate and actionable inventory of properties that can be leased or sold for energy development. One option for implementing this would be to establish a program management office tasked with developing and executing a plan to work with developers on property planning, development, and leasing of DOE-managed lands. </p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>The report lays out a sequence of activities DOE can follow in managing its lands, the first phase of which would include engaging developers of energy projects and infrastructure to internalize commercial best-practices into DOE&rsquo;s management of the disposition or use of its lands. In a second phase, DOE should put in place the administrative procedures needed to make these lands available to developers and for generating revenue, modeled after the method used by the Department of the Interior. Third, DOE should use the information gathered during prior phases to improve its estimates of the costs and benefits of developing its properties for energy projects and should conduct use-cases for select projects. And finally, having identified the properties with the most promising cost-benefit profiles, DOE should solicit commercial input to begin actual development of energy projects on the properties. </p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>The report also offers observations and recommendations about specific energy sources, including the following:</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p><strong>Solar.</strong> The analytical results presented in the NREL analysis for solar are not a fair representation of potential resource development on DOE sites, the report says; the value of solar is potentially underrepresented in the Levelized Cost of Electricity. In follow-on work, DOE should conduct an expanded analysis of solar photovoltaic and solar thermal that goes beyond LCOE to consider technical, economic, and market potential. </p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p><strong>Wind power.</strong> DOE should perform a sensitivity study that illustrates the potential for wind development on DOE-managed lands that addresses federal incentives such as investment tax credits, production tax credits, and renewable energy credits. In addition, the 100 MW limit on product size assumed in the NREL analysis should be reconsidered to more accurately assess the potential for wind development. </p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p><strong>Geothermal.</strong> CSM performed an effective analysis on the relatively limited potential for geothermal development on the DOE sites evaluated. Given the limited number of private-sector groups involved in geothermal development, any future development can occur by direct talks between these firms and DOE. </p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p><strong>Coal and uranium</strong>. DOE should eliminate fossil and uranium resource sites from further consideration for development when compelling factors exist related to current and foreseeable use, and the environmental, legal, or other factors that tend to be associated with developing those resources. In addition, DOE should consider site-specific geologic information when deciding which site should be included in a short list for energy resource development.</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p><strong>Oil and natural gas.</strong> CSM&rsquo;s analysis showed limited opportunities for oil and gas development on DOE lands, due to the size of the property needed for development. Given these findings, DOE should not conduct further analysis. </p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p><strong>Nuclear energy.</strong> Because of the advantages of continuing to use nuclear power in a low carbon future, DOE continues to fund the development of advanced reactors. Most nuclear energy R&amp;D has been at Idaho National Laboratory (INL), and thus other possible locations for advanced reactors on DOE lands were not pursued. Given the status of DOE&rsquo;s nuclear reactor development at INL, DOE should not conduct further analysis, the report says. </p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>The report also examines prospects for development of waste-to-energy, landfill gas, and biomass energy resource development.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The committee believes that DOE management, including at the leadership at the Secretary-level, could provide the appropriate direction and funding to pull together the full range of DOE programs and offices to help realize the potential value of energy development on DOE-managed lands&rdquo;, concluded DeCotis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nThe study was sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy.

					"content": "<p>West Monroe Partners announced today that is has been selected as a finalist in this year&rsquo;s Fierce Innovation Awards:&nbsp; Energy Edition, a utility-reviewed awards program from the publishers of <em>FierceEnergy</em> and <em>FierceSmartGrid</em>.&nbsp; West Monroe was recognized as a finalist in the category of Distribution Management Systems.</p>\n<p>West Monroe was selected as a finalist for its innovative, industry leading product, Connect-the-Grid (CTG). Connect-the-Grid is a Distributed Energy Resource Management (DERMS) tool targeted at helping utilities improve the process of enrolling new distributed generation systems (e.g. rooftop solar) and managing them once they are on-line.&nbsp;CTG dramatically reduces enrollment times and provides insight into the impact distributed generation has on the distribution grid. With the rapid growth of interconnection requests, utilities need tools that allow them to respond quickly while also ensuring that they are not compromising reliability or power quality. Today, most utilities are tasked with manual processes and time consuming analysis due to gathering information from multiple systems for each application--and often, utilities do not have the necessary tools to automate the technical screening of new applications.&nbsp; Automating the enrollment process, creating a central repository for data, and having a platform to visualize grid impacts of new and existing DG assets make up the heart of Connect the Grid. </p>\n<p>Finalists&rsquo; applications were reviewed by an exclusive panel of executives from major North American utilities including CenterPoint Energy, Commonwealth Edison, Duke Energy, Florida Power &amp; Light, National Grid, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company, Portland General Electric, and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric.</p>\n<p>All applications were evaluated based on the following criteria: technology innovation, financial impact, market validation, compatibility with existing networks, end-user customer experience, and overall level of innovation. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Connect-the-Grid eases several utility pain points associated with distributed generation,&rdquo; said Tom Hulsebosch, managing director of the Energy &amp; Utility practice. &ldquo;Utilities are under pressure from both customers and regulatory bodies to move faster. Connect-the-Grid reduces the time it takes to manage the application process and builds a database of all distributed generation on each feeder. Once systems are enrolled, Connect-the-Grid helps automate the technical evaluation of new applications for quicker acceptance or identification of potential issues.&nbsp;Distribution Engineers are able to see the impact of the actual output each system is producing on an individual or aggregate basis. The visualization of actual system generation and comparing it to the feeder peak and minimum loads over time makes CTG an extremely powerful tool.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For more information about Connect-the-Grid, visit our&nbsp;webpage.

					"content": "<p>Last year set a record for the highest number of software M&amp;A transactions since <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://www.mergermarket.com/info/\" target=\"_blank\">Mergermarket</a> began recording data in 1999. According to<a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=8B23BF2839CC4C0B8F8C282812D668FC&amp;_z=z\"> Software M&amp;A Frenzy: Searching For The Competitive Edge</a>, a new report by West Monroe in conjunction with Mergermarket, the momentum behind software firm acquisitions is far from over. Survey data presented in the report shows that corporations and private equity (PE) firms have accumulated vast amounts of cash and are planning to target firms specializing in industry-specific software, business intelligence, and cloud computing. These buyers are looking more closely at firms with an emphasis on finding the right target instead of price. This translates to deals moving faster than ever, with limited time for buyers to conduct due diligence and detect potential post-deal issues involving <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=1BD1BAEF2079416E8FF6CCF14CF0B86F&amp;_z=z\">cybersecurity</a>.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=5DD528D781B44014946829319E06AE96&amp;_z=z\">Matt Sondag</a>, Managing Director of Mergers and Acquisitions for West Monroe Partners, says, &ldquo;You have more funds in existence today and some of the larger funds are coming down market, especially for software assets. You also have strategic buyers, who are typically slower to innovate, buying software assets to buy that innovation. The number of companies that are differentiating themselves in a sale process based on speed is at an all-time high, which is scary and shows you how competitive the market has become.&rdquo; <br />\n<br />\nThe strongest appetite for software acquisitions comes from private equity firms, with 78% of those surveyed planning on three to four acquisitions over the next two years. Meanwhile, 25% of corporations indicate they will be conducting three to four software acquisitions in the same period. <br />\n<br />\nWhile price isn&rsquo;t a driving factor, technology, operations, and, in particular, cybersecurity weigh heavily on the minds of both PE and strategic investors. When evaluating a software target, those surveyed say they want their acquisitions to be operationally ready for launch with strong development procedures and tight speed-to-market capabilities. <br />\n<br />\nThis emphasis on time has led to worries about post-deal issues relating to cybersecurity. More than half of executives surveyed say they have uncovered an issue after a deal closed &ndash; an even higher number than in West Monroe&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.westmonroe.com/Insights/White-Papers/security-survey\">Testing the Defenses: Cybersecurity Due Diligence in M&amp;A</a>&rdquo; survey last year (40%) &ndash; making cybersecurity the second most common reason buyers regretted a deal.<br />\n<br />\nRegardless of cybersecurity fears, data shows that deal volume for software-related M&amp;A rose in the first quarter of 2017 when compared to the same quarter in 2016, and judging by responses from the dealmakers themselves, this is only the beginning.&nbsp;<strong><br />\n</strong></p>\n<h2>Key findings of this report include:</h2>\n<div>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p>When combined, the majority (57%) of corporates and PE respondents expect to execute three to four acquisitions over the next two years.&nbsp;</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>More respondents say the success of a software acquisition primarily depends on technical and operational factors, rather than price.&nbsp;</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>A majority of respondents say they&rsquo;ve walked away from a software deal in the past, with most corporates (23%) citing cybersecurity concerns as the biggest deal-breaker and almost a quarter of PE firms (22%) citing compliance issues.</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=8B23BF2839CC4C0B8F8C282812D668FC&amp;_z=z\">Please click here to read the full report</a>.</p>\n<h2>\nMergermarket\n</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Mergermarket is a business development and market intelligence tool designed specifically for the M&amp;A sector and provides proprietary intelligence and analysis on corporate strategy across the world.

					"content": "<p>More than half of consumers are willing to pay at least 5% higher prices for products ordered online if they&rsquo;re delivered sustainably, and 76% would wait at least one extra day for climate-friendly transport, according to a new study by business and technology consulting firm, West Monroe Partners. Though consumers seem positive about greener delivery, the study found that North American consumers are mostly unaware such delivery options exist. <br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;The modern consumer is paying more than lip service to environmentally-conscious decisions these days, and plenty are willing to put their money &ndash; and patience &ndash; where their mouths are&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Given the dominance of ecommerce and trends such as same and next-day delivery, order fulfillment&rsquo;s impact on the environment is a significant one,&rdquo; said Yves Leclerc, managing director and leader of West Monroe&rsquo;s supply chain practice. &ldquo;Consumers are willing to sacrifice for products delivered in ways that don&rsquo;t yield damaging greenhouse gas emissions &ndash; they just need to be aware of these alternative delivery models first.&rdquo; <br />\n<br />\nIn its Need for Green or Need for Speed study, West Monroe surveyed more than 600 U.S. consumers to determine what compromises they&rsquo;d be willing to make for more sustainable delivery of products purchased online. Highlights from the study include:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>12% of US consumers would pay up to 10% more for sustainable delivery.&nbsp;</li>\n    <li>Annual income was not an influential factor in consumers&rsquo; willingness to pay more for sustainable delivery. In fact, respondents who earn over $100,000 a year were slightly less likely to accept higher prices for climate-friendly transport.&nbsp;</li>\n    <li>Similarly, age had only a minor impact on attitudes toward sustainability, with 18-25 year olds slightly less likely to pay more for climate-friendly transport compared to 26-35 year olds.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<p>However, the study does show that, if knowledgeable about the options available to them, many consumers would make at least minor concessions for more sustainable delivery. <br />\n<br />\nManagement and technology consultancy BearingPoint conducted the same study in Europe and found consumers there are more aware of green delivery options. Of the 1,000 European respondents BearingPoint surveyed, nearly half were aware of climate-friendly shipping alternatives and one in five has already used them. Almost 60 percent were willing to pay more for green shipping and 76% were willing to wait up to three days longer for sustainable delivery. <br />\n<br />\nE-commerce organizations therefore should consider new ways to promote delivery alternatives to please both consumers and shareholders. Firms should build sustainable processes into their supply chains and use tools to track and report on progress. West Monroe and BearingPoint&rsquo;s Logistics Emissions Calculator (LogEC) tool provides companies with detailed calculations and analyses regarding the environmental impact of their transportation while providing specialized optimization potentials. <br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;The modern consumer is paying more than lip service to environmentally-conscious decisions these days, and plenty are willing to put their money &ndash; and patience &ndash; where their mouths are,&rdquo; said Leclerc. &ldquo;E-commerce shops and logistics providers offering options such as flexible delivery windows and transportation modes will miss out on a major opportunity unless they put more effort into educating their customers. In addition, companies that don&rsquo;t implement sustainable delivery practices now expose themselves to shareholder and customer risk as legislation may continue to put limits on a company&rsquo;s carbon emissions.&rdquo; </p>",

Today, more than 990 percent of commercial dental insurance plans are purchased through standalone dental insurers.</p>\n<p>Competitive margins and profitability, relative benefit simplicity, customer retention, and the increasing proof of correlation between oral health and overall health are driving more health insurers to experiment and invest in adding dental benefits to their plans. Convergence opportunities exist between health and dental insurers, especially as both face significant technical investments necessary to modernize core platforms and address consumer demands. As such, standalone dental insurance plans are attractive targets for health plans &ndash; either for acquisition or partnership. In fact, 100 percent of surveyed health plan executives whose companies don&rsquo;t already offer dental benefits plan to do so in the near future.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nThe survey results point toward a gap between market realities and leadership action on the dental side of the industry. Nearly half of dental insurance executives (47 percent) feel convergence is a threat to their business, while 38 percent believe it is both a threat and an opportunity, and 13 percent say it would be &ldquo;positive&rdquo; for their business. However, 24 percent plan to proceed with &ldquo;business as usual,&rdquo; even while 60 percent of all respondents (both dental and health) think the percentage of standalone dental plans will significantly decrease in the next three to five years&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe report, titled <strong><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://www.westmonroe.com/Insights/White-Papers/Standalone-Dental\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Turning Point: The Fate of Standalone Dental,&rdquo;&nbsp;</a></strong> examines several scenarios for the future of standalone dental plans:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p>Dental is absorbed into overall health insurance (one product, one shared premium)</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>Dental plans are brought on as partners to health insurance (two products, shared or separate premiums)</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>Dental plans diversify, expanding into other ancillary coverage such as life and short-term disability, to remain standalone</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n&ldquo;For standalone dental plans, winter is here,&rdquo; said <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://www.westmonroe.com/People/H/HindeWill\" target=\"_blank\">Will Hinde</a>, managing director of West Monroe&rsquo;s Healthcare &amp; Life Sciences practice and co-author of the report. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s absolutely essential that dental plans prepare to be attractive partners, and understand that standing still, or alone, is no longer an option for plans that want to thrive in the future.&rdquo;&nbsp;The survey polled 125 executives at dental plans and health plans across the country. Highlights include:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p>Dental plan and health plan executives agree that health plans have a clear or significant advantage over standalone dental insurers in a bundled scenario &ndash; 82 percent of dental plan execs said so, and 80 percent of health plan execs said so&nbsp;</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>The three biggest factors that will drive the embedding of dental insurance into health insurance, according to respondents, rank as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p>Sixty percent of respondents think the percentage of standalone dental plans will significantly decrease in the next three to five years&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>Forty-three percent of dental plans plan to explore offering ancillary products like vision, hearing, life and disability&nbsp;</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>\nAbout West Monroe Partners</strong><br />\nWest Monroe is a progressive business and technology consulting firm that partners with dynamic organizations to reimagine, build, and operate their businesses at peak performance.

					"content": "<p>M&amp;A is playing a critical role as healthcare companies seek to adapt and thrive in a fast-changing marketplace. Pressure to lower costs and adjust to value-based care models, as well as meet the demands of a technology-driven world, have created a need for buyers to seek healthcare targets capable of evolving within the landscape. These are the main findings of a new report, &ldquo;<a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=FB7D8F7A615E4E7185FE7798783A1CBD&amp;_z=z\">Reshaping Healthcare M&amp;A: How Competition and Technology are Changing the Game</a>,&rdquo; released today by <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.westmonroe.com/\" target=\"_blank\">West Monroe Partners</a> and <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.mergermarket.com/info/\" target=\"_blank\">Mergermarket.</a>There were 579 deals for U.S. healthcare targets in 2017, the second-highest total on record, according to Mergermarket data. The appetite for deals is fueling a highly favorable market for sellers. For instance, the median EBITDA multiple for U.S. healthcare targets increased nearly 3x from 2015 to 2017, reaching the level of 13.8x.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>For buyers, leveraging innovation to save on costs is a key motivation for deals. &ldquo;Everything is about cost take-out, given the amount of competitive pressure in the industry,&rdquo; said <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=DC6446F931B8403785C3DC1F30FEA157&amp;_z=z\">Brad Haller</a>, a director in West Monroe&rsquo;s M&amp;A practice who co-authored the report. &ldquo;All of the different stakeholders are trying to outdo each other on price.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In spite of dealmakers&rsquo; appetites, however, respondents say the top challenge in seeking healthcare deals is the shortage of attractive targets. While definitions of &ldquo;attractive&rdquo; varied, they focused mainly on the dearth of targets valued at US$100m or less; the difficulty in finding companies with the right technology or products to sustain growth; and the lack of targets with the right strategic fit for their business.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Any kind of dip in valuations, especially for biotech acquisitions, could drive a buyer&rsquo;s market in the industry,&rdquo; said Anthony Chambers, a director in West Monroe&rsquo;s Healthcare &amp; Life Sciences practice and co-author of the report. &ldquo;It could be a prime opportunity for companies to come in and use some of the cash that&rsquo;s been sitting offshore for decades.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, increasingly complex technologies and aggressive deal timelines present two of the greatest hurdles to acquirers. Nearly half of respondents (49%) said they were dissatisfied with the cybersecurity due diligence in their recent healthcare deals. That figure is up from 16% in West Monroe&rsquo;s 2017 \"<a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=8B23BF2839CC4C0B8F8C282812D668FC&amp;_z=z\">Software M&amp;A Frenzy</a>\" report and up from 3% in West Monroe&rsquo;s 2016 <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=08689841464F474190CD3039C9055430&amp;_z=z\">&ldquo;Cybersecurity Due Diligence in M&amp;A&rdquo;</a> report.</p>\n<h2>Key findings of the report include:&nbsp;</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p>41% of respondents said a company&rsquo;s preparedness to respond to regulatory change was a top concern when it comes to operational or personnel issues, and 40% said a management team&rsquo;s willingness and ability to adapt to market trends was a top priority.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>Only 10% of participants report being very satisfied with IT due diligence, yet 48% are driven to acquisitions to disrupt incumbents using technology.

					"content": "<p>CHICAGO &ndash; As work becomes increasingly digital and automated, this new environment requires updated skills. Yet, both employers and employees detect a sizable skills deficit. More than half &ndash; 56 percent &ndash; of organizations believe they have a moderate to severe skills gap today, and 60 percent of employees believe that, to some extent, their current skill set will become outdated in the next three to five years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These are among the key findings in a new report, <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=6D05DC638AF34C1B89670BA0EA5BB4B1&amp;_z=z\">&ldquo;The Upskilling Crisis: Effectively Enabling and Retraining Employees for the Future,&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;released today by West Monroe Partners, a business and technology consultancy.\n</p>\n<p>\n&ldquo;The urgency for upskilling comes at a time when emerging skill sets are scarce and the talent market is tight &ndash; making it prudent to keep people even if they don&rsquo;t have the right skills right now,&rdquo; said Michael Hughes, managing director and leader of West Monroe&rsquo;s <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=2C09FA607F05454A844E38C7F15C6360&amp;_z=z\">Operations Excellence</a>&nbsp;practice. &ldquo;Indeed, it&rsquo;s often cheaper to retrain current employees than find and hire new ones, as the consequences of turnover can be felt at the bottom line.&rdquo;\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the past year, 70 percent of organizations have introduced at least one new technology designed to increase employee capacity. Employers and employees agree these employee-enablement tools create value. Among employers, 78 percent say enablement technology makes the organization more efficient, and 71 percent say it increases productivity. Sixty-one percent of employees believe technology helps them deliver a higher quality of work output, while 56 percent agree that it allows them to work more efficiently and frees time for additional tasks.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\nEnabling managers will be key to addressing technology adoption, disruption, and upskilling challenges. Many organizations, however, are missing the mark, as 63 percent have not equipped managers with upskilling resources. Sixty-five percent of those surveyed feel the people responsible for leading the way during change &ndash; managers and senior leaders &ndash; need upskilling and reskilling, themselves. Furthermore, 43 percent believe managers don&rsquo;t know how to upskills and reskill employees, and another 39 percent feel they don&rsquo;t have the time to do so.\n</p>\n<p>\"The survey results strongly support the need for significant investment in manager development and enablement if organizations are to realize the impact of digital transformation on the bottom line,&rdquo; said Hughes. &ldquo;The results also point to the importance of human-centered design in their approach to upskilling. Before implementing any sort of enablement technology, organizations need to consider the employee journey and how the selected tool(s) will add value &ndash; but only 16 percent of those surveyed do so consistently.&rdquo;\n</p>\n<p>\nWest Monroe partnered with the Human Capital Media Research and Advisory Group, the research arm of Human Capital Media, to conduct a pair of surveys on employer and employee attitudes toward upskilling and employee enablement technologies. More than 430 people at the manager level and above, across various industries, participated in the employer survey; 1,000 people participated in the employee survey, representing a wide range of industries and job levels across the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\nA full copy of the report is available <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=6D05DC638AF34C1B89670BA0EA5BB4B1&amp;_z=z\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About West Monroe Partners</span></strong><br>\nWest Monroe is a national business and technology consulting firm that partners with dynamic organizations to reimagine, build, and operate their businesses at peak performance.

					"content": "<p><em>Survey of 100 industry leaders shows 68% will use more technology-based tools, vs. people, to conduct diligence on targets</em></p>\n<p>CHICAGO&mdash;West Monroe, one of the fastest-growing digital firms, today released its latest signature research report, &ldquo;<a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=338732901BBE426789A5AE0BD24093E5&amp;_z=z\">The Future of Diligence in Private Equity</a>.&rdquo; The report analyzes survey responses from 100 private equity leaders on the state of due diligence today along with their expectations&mdash;and predictions&mdash;for the future.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The primary finding: Private equity is shifting focus away from risk mitigation and toward identification of value creation opportunities during diligence on potential targets. Indeed, when asked what they anticipate will be the primary drivers of change to diligence in the next 1&ndash;3 years, respondents&rsquo; clear top answer was a higher focus on value creation vs. risk mitigation (73%), ahead of regulations (54%) and ESG standards (25%).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The shift, in an effort to address competitive bidding dynamics and higher valuations, will come with change:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p>70% say they&rsquo;ll use more data during the diligence process and 68% say they&rsquo;ll use more tech and tools, vs. people</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>Two-thirds say they are more likely to buy targets in the future that have completed sell-side diligence</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>27% say that &ldquo;recommendations aligned to the investment thesis&rdquo; is most the most valued part of diligence today, but 40% say it will be the most valued part in the future</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The survey also asked private equity leaders about ESG. While 67% of respondents say their current approach to ESG diligence is consistent across targets, only 40% say they will maintain that consistency in the future&mdash;choosing to, instead, more often customize ESG diligence by the type of target.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Regardless of the type of diligence, less than half of private equity leaders say they often incorporate diligence outputs and recommendations into the value creation plan over the hold period. That represents a huge opportunity as PE firms increasingly rely on value creation to justify higher multiples.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The transfer of knowledge from the deal teams to the operating teams, with intelligence and recommendations from the diligence report, isn&rsquo;t happening as often as it should,&rdquo; said <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=DC6446F931B8403785C3DC1F30FEA157&amp;_z=z\">Brad Haller</a>, senior partner in West Monroe&rsquo;s M&amp;A practice. &ldquo;But translating findings into action is a critical step for financial sponsors to get the most value out of the diligence effort&rdquo;</p>\n<p>To adapt to a diligence process that requires more data, technology, and automation, PE firms need to take critical steps to modernize and innovate within their deal operations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As serial acquirers, PE firms are experts in due diligence, but they&rsquo;re also known for prioritizing investments in their portcos over their own processes and skillsets,&rdquo; said <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=0CCAC555BDED4E2AA165F3272BF5BCFD&amp;_z=z\">Keith Campbell</a>, senior partner in West Monroe&rsquo;s M&amp;A practice. &ldquo;We are just starting to see the tide turn with regard to investing in digital, analytics, and labor productivity to evolve their diligence capabilities and address the current diligence market pressures.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Future of Diligence in Private Equity&rdquo; surveyed 100 private equity leaders via an online survey in Q4 2021. The report analyzes the survey responses and offer steps PE firms can take to modernize diligence and focus on value creation.

Both studies examined potential scenarios for the future of dental plans, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Dental is absorbed into overall health insurance (one product, one shared premium)</li>\n    <li>Dental plans are brought on as partners to health insurance (two products, shared or separate premiums)</li>\n    <li>Dental plans diversify, expanding into other ancillary coverage such as life, short-term disability, and pet insurance to remain standalone offerings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, the percentage of health insurers offering dental insurance products has risen substantially, from 68% in 2018 to 80% today, and the percentage offering adult dental benefits has more than doubled to 48%&mdash;clear evidence of an accelerating shift toward convergence.</p>\n<p>\"It is becoming apparent that the health and dental insurance industries are on the verge of convergence, threatening to upend the standalone-dental business model.

					"content": "<p>CHICAGO- Private equity firms are poised to benefit from digital by delivering efficiency improvements, revenue, and earnings growth that yield higher pricing multiples at exit. Yet many firms are not equipped to seize the digital opportunities available to their portfolio companies, according to a new report released today by business and technology consulting firm West Monroe in partnership with Mergermarket.The firm released its results in a new report, &ldquo;Digital at the Speed of Private Equity: How to Increase EBITDA through Digital Investments in the Middle Market.&rdquo;\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Only 42 percent of private equity firms report having a standard definition of digital that guides strategic decisions and aligns all parties. Additionally, 40 percent say that half or fewer of their portfolio companies have a documented digital strategy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Most private equity firms, however, recognize the value of digital and believe it has an impact on exit price. Half of general partners include digital value creation as part of their investment thesis, and more than 8 in 10 respondents said they view mature digital investments at a portfolio company as a value driver at exit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>&ldquo;From our perspective, digital will define private equity&rsquo;s next chapter. In the sky-high valuation environment of recent years, the need to identify innovative and effective investment angles to create value has never been more pressing,&rdquo; said Nick Hahn, a director of digital transformation at&nbsp; West Monroe. &ldquo;The ability of firms to develop a digitally led investment thesis, carry out effective digital diligence, and deliver on their strategies will separate the industry&rsquo;s best and weakest performers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>West Monroe, in partnership with Mergermarket, surveyed 100 executives of U.S.-based private equity firms that invest in middle-market organizations across a range of industries. The survey explored the extent to which private equity investors prioritize digital today, key challenges, and specific opportunities for realizing benefits.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>&ldquo;While private investors are innately pragmatic about deciding which project to execute, they can be skeptical when it comes to digital projects, often viewing them as a cost center or taking too long to deliver,&rdquo; said <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=DC6446F931B8403785C3DC1F30FEA157&amp;_z=z\">Brad Haller</a>, a director in West Monroe&rsquo;s Mergers &amp; Acquisitions practice. &ldquo;As technology advisors to the private equity space, we see an opportunity for the industry to shift its thinking to digital as a growth-enabler.&rdquo;\n</p>\n<p>Other key findings of the report include:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p>The need for digital is driven by both internal constraints and external market forces. Nearly a third (30 percent) of respondents cited competitive disruption as a key driver, while 26 percent reported a high level of operating inefficiency and cost and 22 percent reported rising expectations around customer experience.&nbsp;</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>While digital diligence focuses most on a company&rsquo;s efficiency (100 percent), most private equity firms (89 percent) also include maturity/competitive and productivity analyses. Nearly half of respondents (45 percent) said the single most important aspect of a target&rsquo;s digital profile is the maturity/competitive component.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>Customer experience looms large when making digital investments: 40 percent of those surveyed said they prioritize investments that help the portfolio company keep pace with customers&rsquo; expectations.&nbsp;</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>Three quarters of private equity investors make digital investments in order to improve the exit price for a portfolio company without the expectation of performance gains before the sale.&nbsp;</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>A full copy of the report is available <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=12670E4B36F74E52A5CC711C360FE188&amp;_z=z\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The study builds on West Monroe&rsquo;s October 2018 research, &ldquo;<a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=E5091A4987794D01B2F69E04FEF8F9C5&amp;_z=z\">Digital Leaders: Learn from Digitally Mature Companies to Grow Revenue and Profits</a>,&rdquo; which highlighted key activities and characteristics that drive stellar financial performance.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About West Monroe Partners</span></strong><br />\nWest Monroe is a national business and technology consulting firm that partners with dynamic organizations to reimagine, build, and operate their businesses at peak performance.

					"content": "<p>Despite disruption and economic upheaval, the appetite for deals in the high-tech &amp;&nbsp;software sector has not waned during the pandemic. Private equity and corporate buyers expect deal activity to remain strong: 70% said they plan to acquire as many as two software/high-tech companies over the next 24 months, and 27% intend to make three or four acquisitions. These are among the principal findings in a new report, &ldquo;<a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=627EF97A62154429B05A3BBC0F41057B&amp;_z=z\">High Tech M&amp;A Defies the Odds</a>,&rdquo; released today by West Monroe and Mergermarket.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe report explores the demand, strategy, diligence, and post-close process for buyers of high-tech &amp; software companies. As a basis for the report, West Monroe and Mergermarket surveyed 100 private equity and corporate/strategic buyers during the third quarter of 2020.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;A lot has changed in a short time, and so have assumptions around the models and strategies that will deliver growth and value,&rdquo; said Michael Amiot, senior director in West Monroe&rsquo;s mergers &amp; acquisitions practice. &ldquo;High-quality assets continue to attract high multiples. But high multiples, a crowded market, and unique integration and differentiation challenges make the path to value creation more difficult. Buyers need conviction and clear plans for long-term value creation to justify meeting valuation expectations in an uncertain market.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nKey findings of the study include:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Global deal value for the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) industry increased 21% through the third quarter of 2020, compared to the same period a year ago. Although 60% of survey respondents said they postponed or canceled plans to make a software or technology acquisition as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, 55% said they expect their deal appetite to either increase or stay the same over the next 24 months. </li>\n    <li>Private equity investors in high-tech &amp; software have primarily focused on consolidation or scaling up to increase competitiveness (74%) and transformation, for example through new intellectual property (66%). Corporate buyers are different:&nbsp; Their primary objectives for recent high-tech and software acquisitions were incorporating a specific functionality or intellectual property into an organization to enable product differentiation (72%) and acquiring a new customer base (64%).</li>\n    <li>Subscription revenue is a priority, particularly for private equity; 40% of private equity respondents said that 50% to 70% of their tech portfolio markets goods or services to customers on a subscription basis. By contrast, half of corporate buyers surveyed report that less than 50% of their revenue comes from subscriptions.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&ldquo;Growth in subscription and software-as-a-service models have been at the center of many investment theses, with private equity investors being more aggressive in this area,&rdquo; said <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=E1053CB2D0C148C4A440ADF095A5ACA2&amp;_z=z\">Dhaval Moogimane</a>, a director in West Monroe&rsquo;s high-tech &amp; software practice. &ldquo;While corporate acquirers appreciate the power of subscriptions, private equity firms are better able to execute the transition to these sorts of business models. This shift can be difficult for large corporations due to investor expectations and a focus on near-term financial results.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nAdditional contributors to the report include Neil Jain, director in West Monroe&rsquo;s high-tech &amp; Software practice, and Katherine Swintek, senior manager in West Monroe&rsquo;s mergers &amp; acquisitions practice.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nWest Monroe is a market-leading advisor for high-tech &amp; software companies and private equity firms. Since 2002, the firm has advised on more than 3,000 transactions and executed hundreds of post-close value creation investments for portfolio companies, many of them in the high-tech &amp; software sector. West Monroe previously published a study on software M&amp;A in 2017, &ldquo;<a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=8B23BF2839CC4C0B8F8C282812D668FC&amp;_z=z\">Software M&amp;A Frenzy</a>.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>About the survey<br />\n</strong>Survey respondents were equally divided between private equity and corporate/strategic buyers based in the United States. Private equity participants qualified to take the survey if they had acquired or sold three or more high-tech &amp; software companies over the past three years.

The report focuses on innovation and the business opportunities it brings. It also looks at the origins of innovation, whether driven by economics, regulators, or customers.</p>\n<p>West Monroe hones in on the topic of&nbsp;<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://visual.ly/playing-win-using-situational-awareness-decision-making\">Situational Awareness </a>in a spotlight feature as part of the report, describing how situational awareness helps organizations improve customer engagement and deliver better services by using the information at their fingertips. The main premise of situational awareness is to center decision-making (and action-taking) on a specific situation with the use of data available to organizations.</p>\n<p>\nThe article explores the theory and includes a Q&amp;A with Chicago&rsquo;s former CIO, Brett Goldstein, to uncover best practices. Goldstein gives insights on how they used situational awareness to improve decision making in the city. The interview explains how situational awareness can incorporate data analytics into the &lsquo;business as usual&rsquo; of running a city like Chicago, driving significant improvements to decision-making and service delivery. <br />\n<br />\nAdditionally the BearingPoint Institute looks into new market trends: as governments and banks exit the large-scale infrastructure funding sector, authors investigate if institutional investors such as insurers will bridge the funding gap. The report also explores innovative sector strategies, showing what Europe&rsquo;s public healthcare systems can learn from private customer relationship management and how retailers can integrate the best of physical and digital to foster cross-channel success.<br />\n<br />\nPer Jacobsson, BearingPoint Partner and lead for the BearingPoint Institute, commented on this year&rsquo;s report: &ldquo;Using research, analysis and examples from banking, healthcare, infrastructure and retail as well as interviews with top business thinkers, this third BearingPoint Institute Report provides insights into innovation and business management unseen elsewhere.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;West Monroe&rsquo;s contribution to the third annual BearingPoint Institute Report signifies the strength of our partnership, ability to collaborate and overall global reach with BearingPoint,&rdquo; said Gil Mermelstein, West Monroe Partners managing director and global corporate development lead.<br />\n<br />\n<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.westmonroe.com/press-releases/bearingpoint-cited-as-a-visionary-in-the-customer-management-field-by-a-major-industry-analysis-firm\">Download the BearingPoint Institute report on your tablet.&nbsp;</a></p>\n<h2>\nAbout the BearingPoint Institute</h2>\n<p>\nFounded in 2009, the BearingPoint Institute is an incisive, authoritative voice on business-critical topics, which brings together the finest minds from both within and outside the BearingPoint organisation.

					"content": "<p>West Monroe Partners, a full-service business and technology consulting firm, announced today the findings from its latest study of customers, utility executives and utility regulators on the present and future state of <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=12E15E979EDD42B99099721EF56E273D&amp;_z=z\">distributed energy resources (DERs)</a>. The study found the interest and growth of DERs is increasing among residential customers particularly, but some utility executives and regulators have yet to settle on collaborative ways to prepare for the potential shift. </p>\n<p>Commercial and industrial customers have long led the charge for self-generation technologies; however, the tide is changing as residential customers increasingly look to adopt DERs in their homes and neighborhoods through shared resources such as community solar. According to West Monroe Partner&rsquo;s study, residential customers are the largest group adding DERs as cited by 82 percent of utility executives, closely followed by commercial and industrial customers (77%). </p>\n<p>A combination of factors is impacting customers&rsquo; interest in DERs, from the social benefits to their economic and reliability benefits. Of customers that have adopted renewable energy sources, 71 percent did so to lower their utility bill and 17 percent did in response to their stated environmental stewardship.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;While DER adoption is beneficial for customers and the environment, it&rsquo;s forcing the utility industry and regulators to reconsider the traditional utility business model and how the utility monetizes the value of the services it offers to customers,&rdquo; said Tom Hulsebosch, managing director in West Monroe&rsquo;s Energy &amp; Utilities practice. </p>\n<p>Despite residential customers&rsquo; increased interest in DERs, only 37 percent of utility executives offer DER-specific support services, systems or technologies, and 59 percent plan to make no or minimal investments to support DERs unless mandated to do so. Utilities' inaction is attributed to the industry's lack of clarity around DERs' impact on their systems and regulatory uncertainties. The study found 66 percent of executives feel DERs are both a threat and opportunity for their businesses.</p>\n<p>Utility executives hold a conservative outlook toward the spread of distributed energy resources within their systems. Sixty-eight percent of executives expect DER technologies to only provide 1 to 5 percent of supply resources in the next five years, and 47 percent believe small residential systems will be the most prevalent source of DERs on their systems in the next five years, followed by third-party power providers, the utility itself, and commercial/industrial systems.</p>\n<p>Compared to utility executives, regulators are already modifying their requirements and compliance requirements to support DER integration. Regulators cite a handful of concerns driving the proposed changes. Grid reliability was ranked by regulators as the top factor driving regulatory action to support DERs with 78 percent, followed by rising costs of delivered energy and requests from external stakeholders with 67 percent. </p>\n<p>Supporting DERs and integrating them into daily utility operations will not come without challenges. According to the study, 61 percent of utility executives believe capital and financial constraints are barriers to DER adoption and support, while 61 percent of regulators believe regulatory barriers are the most significant obstacles. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Utility executives and regulators have contrasting views on the amount of DER penetration that can be readily absorbed into the existing grid without fundamental changes being made to accommodate them,&rdquo; said Paul A. DeCotis, director in West Monroe&rsquo;s Energy &amp; Utilities practice and East Coast lead. &ldquo;This divide, along with technology availability and cost, pivoting business models and public policy interests, have put a hold on the amount of DER integration expected to come on line in the immediate future. These and other issues continue to impede the industry&rsquo;s ability to accommodate new energy technologies and gain greater support, DeCotis said.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Educating customers on these new technologies is another barrier to DER adoption. The study found 69 percent of customers do not know if their utility offers DERs enrollment and 94 percent say their providers haven&rsquo;t approached them about alternative energy options. Utilities that fail to educate customers and provide a sufficient DER customer experience may suffer business and compliance consequences, and as a result, more oversight from regulators. </p>\n<p>A copy of the full survey results can be found <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://www.westmonroe.com/Insights/White-Papers/Distributed-Energy-Resources\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>",

A notable 90% of HH organizations report that they measure, reward, and recognize employees for working collaboratively to achieve business results.</li>\n    <li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Development </strong>&ndash; In a competitive talent market, 100% of HH companies have a defined learning and upskilling strategy to build necessary digital skills. Critically, these organizations have key ownership for training and learning from across the business&mdash;not just within human resources or talent management.&nbsp;</li>\n    <li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Retention</strong> &ndash; HH companies are also effectively battling societal trends like the &ldquo;Great Resignation&rdquo; and &ldquo;quiet quitting.&rdquo; A notable 80% of HH organizations say they have the strategies needed to improve talent retention or already retain all the talent needed to be successful.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In addition to the four key drivers, the report also identifies 10 statistically significant attributes that are correlated with high performance and high digital agility.

					"content": "<p>Nearly two-thirds of organizations consider the ability to adapt quickly a top strategic priority. However, few have developed mature capabilities, and no corporate role has emerged as primary owner of the initiative. These are among the key findings from survey results released today by West Monroe Partners, a national business and technology consultancy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The survey, conducted with members of the Customer Experience Professionals Association (CXPA), assessed the current state of business agility and the role customer experience leaders and practitioners play in existing efforts. The research paper, <strong><a href=\"http://www.westmonroe.com/Insights/White-Papers/Adapt-or-Fail\">&ldquo;Adapt or Fail: The New Business Imperative,&rdquo;</a></strong> is available for free download.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nA focus on increased adaptability stems from its perceived impact on competitive advantage in an evolving digital, consumer-driven marketplace. Faster time to market (52 percent) and increased innovation (47 percent) are the most anticipated benefits of business agility, and 71 percent of survey participants expect greater agility to translate into improved customer experience.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Customer behavior is changing as fast as digital capabilities evolve, and firms that respond too slowly or are too vested in existing business models find themselves eclipsed by newcomers or big technology outsiders,&rdquo; said Paul Hagen,&nbsp;senior principal and West Monroe&rsquo;s leader for customer experience and innovation strategy. &ldquo;On the other hand, companies that quickly evolve their capabilities to drive new value to customers can create an &lsquo;adaptive advantage.&rsquo; To do so, they need deep understanding of the issues customers are trying to solve or, better yet, the ability to foresee future issues and help customers in areas they don&rsquo;t even know they need help.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>\nAmong the survey&rsquo;s top findings:</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p>Despite the compelling benefits, &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; for agility efforts remains widely dispersed among corporate roles. Top contenders include the chief executive officer, chief operating officer, and customer experience leader, but no single role exceeds 28 percent. For almost a quarter &ndash; 23 percent &ndash; of organizations, no one is in charge of efforts to improve adaptability.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>Agility efforts are mostly new, with 57 percent of survey participants classifying their organizations as becoming agile within the past three years. Nearly half &ndash; 48 percent &ndash; characterized their company&rsquo;s agility efforts as &ldquo;preliminary.&rdquo;</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>Top challenges to becoming more agile include culture (54 percent), inflexibility of legacy systems (43 percent), and lack of leadership alignment (41 percent). About 3 in 4 respondents said that fewer than half of their company&rsquo;s teams use any sort of method to accelerate business agility.</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nTo learn more, download the full study report: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://www.westmonroe.com/Insights/White-Papers/Adapt-or-Fail\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Adapt or Fail: The New Business Imperative.&rdquo;</a></p>\n<h2>\nAbout the Customer Experience Professionals Association</h2>\n<p>\nFounded in 2011, the Customer Experience Professionals Association is the premier global non-profit organization dedicated to the advancement and cultivation of the customer experience profession.

					"content": "<p>CHICAGO &ndash; West Monroe Partners, a national business and technology consultancy, today announced that it has elevated innovation to a strategic initiative in 2019 and is doubling its investment in incubating new technology-based products and business solutions that bring value to its clients and the market. To kick off its new innovation strategy, West Monroe will celebrate a &ldquo;week of innovation&rdquo; ahead of National Innovation Day on February 16. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Practical innovation has been a core value from our firm&rsquo;s inception and has always been a key part of the value that we bring to our clients and the market. Given both our rapid growth and the accelerating pace of technology evolution, this is the right time to shift our innovation engine to the next gear,&rdquo; said President and CEO <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=4D415E5E7A104990BE2F9291F0C4F49A&amp;_z=z\">Kevin McCarty</a>. &ldquo;Personally, I am inspired by the opportunities we have to work with companies willing to embrace innovation, which is key to growing and thriving in a disrupted business environment.&rdquo;\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The firm&rsquo;s reinvigoration around innovation comes on the heels of three C-level promotions, including the elevation of Tom Bolger to chief strategy officer, whose primary area of focus will include innovation. In January the firm hired Tyson Hartman to fill a newly created position, senior director of innovation and partnerships; Hartman will report to Bolger within West Monroe&rsquo;s Strategic Growth function. Hartman will lead research into technology trends, refine innovation and alliance strategies, and source innovative concepts and external partnerships that leverage both internal and external expertise. He will be based out of the firm&rsquo;s second-largest office in Seattle. Previously, Hartman was the executive vice president of innovation and incubation with Avanade, Inc.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n&ldquo;Tyson has a proven track record for launching high-profit entrepreneurial ventures inside of enterprise-level corporations. I am thrilled for him to apply this experience at West Monroe and accelerate the innovative ideas coming from our people,&rdquo; said Chief Strategy Officer Tom Bolger.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>In addition to hiring Hartman, the firm introduced a new career path for its technologist work force centered around innovation. The new role, called an Innovation Fellow, will allow employees to progress within West Monroe by focusing on product and service innovation, where success and incentives are tied to innovation instead of client delivery. Creating a career path where innovation isn&rsquo;t an added responsibility, but the primary focus is a direct response to employee feedback and market needs. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>West Monroe introduced a formal innovation strategy in 2014 centered around developing world-class capabilities. Since then, it has continued to refine its approach for encouraging employees to propose and develop new product and service ideas that create value.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 2017, the firm launched a <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/40571881/these-are-the-three-things-to-invest-in-to-build-employee-loyalty\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Shark Tank&rdquo;</a> program (patterned after the ABC television series) that evaluates and funds employee ideas with time and money. Since then, it has allocated the firm&rsquo;s resources to eight teams to develop ideas such as a Health Cloud Accelerator, a Rapid Analytics Platform, and robotic process automation <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=448448856613479AA882DC0DE793B8A2&amp;_z=z\">(RPA) tools for dental plans</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=216FD01B780548FC93F8EAEDDB5847B0&amp;_z=z\">financial services</a>&nbsp;organizations. During 2018, West Monroe teams logged more than 10,000 hours to develop those and other ideas. The firm has realized a return on investment in excess of 200 percent to date across the investment portfolio.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWest Monroe recently funded its first $1 million innovation team, which is refining the firm&rsquo;s Mergers &amp; Acquisitions engagement and delivery model to create value through proprietary data and other enhancements.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>In 2019, West Monroe is increasing the funding available to develop employee-generated ideas and refining its processes for reviewing and investing in those ideas. Later this year, the firm will introduce an enterprise-wide idea management platform to manage virtual innovation challenges. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>&ldquo;One of the advantages of working in a talent-rich consulting organization is the wealth of great ideas. This allows us to continuously build new innovations that turn our consulting experience into proven tools and accelerators that we can tailor quickly to help our clients speed up their path to change, realize value faster, and achieve competitive advantage,&rdquo; Bolger said.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 2019, West Monroe will evolve innovation investment to a venture capital style approach that includes three levels of funding: seed funding through annual planning process, funding approved by a Concept Advisory Board to build and test ideas, and ultimately the &ldquo;Shark Tank&rdquo; to provide more significant levels of capital required for market readiness.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>About West Monroe Partners</strong><br />\nWest Monroe is a national business and technology consulting firm that partners with dynamic organizations to reimagine, build, and operate their businesses at peak performance.

					"content": "<p>WEDNESDAY, DEC. 1 &mdash; Today, West Monroe announced it has acquired Carbon Five, a national product management, digital design, and software engineering firm.</p>\n<p>The acquisition is part of West Monroe&rsquo;s strategy to expand its end-to-end digital services in response to unprecedented market demand and comes on the heels of acquiring Verys, a 200-person product development firm, in September. The additions of Verys and Carbon Five round out the foundation for West Monroe&rsquo;s new, innovative approach to digital consulting that combines expertise in technology, design, and industry-led business strategy to help clients become digital leaders.</p>\n<p>Carbon Five brings to West Monroe a proven methodology and product delivery processes that have helped startup companies and Fortune 1000 firms gain market share in their industries. The firm is an expert in building superior digital products and preparing its clients for long-term success by elevating their product management and development capabilities. The company&rsquo;s nearly 100 designers, product managers, and software engineers boost West Monroe&rsquo;s ability to deliver across the breadth of the product lifecycle and provide depth in engagements with clients&rsquo; product environments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As part of West Monroe, Carbon Five will collaborate across the firm in multidisciplinary teams made up of technologists, industry experts, business strategists, product engineers, and others to provide a comprehensive set of solutions to West Monroe clients. More than ever, companies need a partner with this multidisciplinary expertise to help them build integrated experiences that combine the physical and digital worlds and align business operations to the new way of working. That is why the firm is building a global product development platform and will continue to invest heavily in this area, with future acquisitions planned to enhance capabilities and scale.</p>\n<p>Carbon Five was founded in 2000 and has offices and talent in four major markets: Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, and Chattanooga.

					"content": "<p><em>Also in process is a search for a new Chief Marketing Officer with global brand experience.</em></p>\n<p>December 9, 2021&mdash;West Monroe, one of the fastest-growing digital consulting firms, announced today the expansion of its leadership team through two new C-suite roles. The firm is adding a Chief Revenue Officer, who will be responsible for streamlining and fortifying revenue generation across the firm, and a Chief Commercial Officer, who will be responsible for commercializing repeatable offerings that deliver value for clients and help them become digital.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The new roles, which will be supported by new teams and functions, are part of West Monroe&rsquo;s strategy to become the leading digital consultancy in North America. Within this strategy, the firm is investing heavily in creating value for clients through the use of multidisciplinary offerings that solve for clients&rsquo; most pressing issues. It also is invested in scaling the firm&rsquo;s revenue generation processes and programs to free up delivery teams to focus on clients. Both objectives require dedicated leadership to achieve firm goals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each new role, effective Jan. 2, 2022, will be filled by existing, accomplished executives at West Monroe who have built teams and functions previously:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p><strong>Tom Ewers</strong>, currently the Central region and Minneapolis office leader, will become the <strong>Chief Revenue Officer</strong>. Ewers has been with West Monroe since 2002, opening the Minneapolis office in 2013 and launching the Consumer &amp; Industrial Products practice in 2018. He will build and lead a Revenue Growth team responsible for making sure all revenue-generating activities&mdash;including sales, client service, delivery success, and quality&mdash;are fully aligned and focused on helping clients achieve digital leadership. He will continue to oversee the Minneapolis office.&nbsp;</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p><strong>Casey Foss</strong>, currently the Chief Marketing Officer, will become the <strong>Chief Commercial Officer</strong>. Foss joined West Monroe in 2008 and has led the marketing function for a decade. She will now build and lead a new Commercial Growth team responsible for driving new growth, in partnership with firm operators. Her priorities will include consistent and repeatable methodologies and approaches to issues, <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=85A6DC6B7E9143288044D08A8D81899D&amp;_z=z\">offerings</a>, <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=641B188C4F1F412BB9D365D9B80B0FF1&amp;_z=z\">Intellio&trade; asset suite</a>, and value creation, as well as market intelligence to keep the firm focused on areas that are most important to clients. Her team also will lead the training and development of digital skills among West Monroe employees.</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>With Foss changing roles, the firm is immediately recruiting for a new chief marketing officer with a track record for building a global brand presence. She will serve as chief marketing officer until a new executive is in place.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;These new roles and appointments ensure we have the right leadership focus and dedicated resources in place to orchestrate our strategy as we grow,&rdquo; said <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=4D415E5E7A104990BE2F9291F0C4F49A&amp;_z=z\">Kevin McCarty</a>, West Monroe&rsquo;s chairman and CEO. &ldquo;They reflect the significant contributions Casey Foss and Tom Ewers have made over many years. We are excited not only for their growth in these new roles, but for the focus and energy this will bring in areas critical to our clients and business.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Established in 2002, West Monroe has grown its revenue at a 30% CAGR and achieved national prominence by becoming a top alternative to the largest consulting firms. While many of its competitors specialize in either strategy or implementation&mdash;or in business or technology&mdash;West Monroe is built on the principle that all of its consultants are fluent across strategy, implementation, business, and technology. The firm assembles multidisciplinary, industry-led teams of experts who help clients become digital leaders in their industries at a time when digital leadership has never been more critical to commercial success.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About West Monroe</strong><br />\nWest Monroe is a digital consulting firm that was born in technology but built for business&mdash;partnering with companies in transformative industries to deliver quantifiable financial value. We believe that digital is a mindset&mdash;not a project, a team, or a destination&mdash;and it&rsquo;s something companies become, not something they do. That&rsquo;s why we work in diverse, multidisciplinary teams that blend industry expertise with deep operational and technology capabilities&mdash;moving clients from traditional to digital operating models and creating products and experiences that transcend the digital and physical worlds.

Founded in 1994 by Harvard Business School Professor Michael Porter, ICIC expands inner city economies by providing businesses, governments and investors with the most comprehensive and actionable information in the field about urban market opportunities. ICIC's unique knowledge and expertise about inner city success factors and thriving companies is developed from specialized urban networks and path-breaking research. <br />\n<br />\nNotes: To qualify for the Inner City 100 list, companies were required to have at least 51 percent of their operations located in an economically distressed urban area; have at least 10 full-time employees; and a five-year operating sales history that includes at least $200,000 in revenues in the first year of consideration, an increase in year five sales over year four sales, and fifth-year sales of at least $1 million. &nbsp;For the 2013 list, ICIC looked at total revenue growth from 2007 to 2011 and the specific rankings were based on these growth rates. &nbsp;An economically distressed urban area is defined by ICIC as having a 50 percent higher unemployment level, 50 percent higher poverty level, and 50 percent lower median income than the metropolitan statistical area.</p>",

The redesigned intranet, first introduced to employees in February 2018, is featured in detail in Nielsen Norman&rsquo;s Group&rsquo;s new report, Intranet Design Annual 2020: The Year&rsquo;s 10 Best Intranets.</p>\n<p>West Monroe and Con Edison, one of the nation's largest investor-owned energy-delivery companies, collaborated to develop Conor. <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=64D57FB85BEE4A5D832DDB33CFD47898&amp;_z=z\">The intranet brings more than 15,000 employees across several utility subsidiaries together in one modern, digital workplace</a>&nbsp;that promotes the company&rsquo;s safety, engagement, operational excellence, and customer service goals. Its many new features include enhanced search and navigation capabilities, a standard look-and-feel, the ability to personalize content by role and municipal borough, and redesigned employee communications, as well as digital forms that streamline work.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Our intranet serves people in diverse roles, so it is important that it offers a flexible and fluid way to surface content that is highly relevant to users and targets communications to the right groups,&rdquo; said Lionel Ing, Con Edison&rsquo;s project sponsor. &ldquo;In addition to helping us achieve critical business goals, modernizing our workplace will save on costs by reducing the time employees spend locating tools and information, employing standard templates to develop departmental content and sites, and introducing new digital forms with automated workflows.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nMost Con Edison employees use Conor every day. Satisfaction with the new intranet increased 30% following the launch. Additionally, search utilization increased by 50%, enabling greater employee self-service and engagement. Through the project, Con Edison reduced intranet content from more than 1,200 pages to just 120 pages.<br />\n<br />\nWest Monroe and Con Edison designed Conor for employees, first and foremost. They relied on agile principles to design and deploy Conor, and targeted four prime user personas to guide the development effort.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Creating a modern, digital workplace is not just about technology. A vital first step in this process is developing a very thorough understanding of how employees work and how they work together. This guides thinking about how the new intranet solution could help create a more productive, connected, empowered, and engaged workforce,&rdquo; said <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=E26B14F0CD6945DA817BF377EE6B7E8D&amp;_z=z\">Kaumil Dalal</a>, director in West Monroe&rsquo;s Technology practice. &ldquo;Another factor that contributed to the project&rsquo;s success was Con Edison&rsquo;s commitment to a comprehensive change management approach that targeted adoption and buy-in from the Corporate Affairs team and departmental content managers and authors, as well as employee users of the site.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nThe project team developed Conor on the SharePoint platform, serving as a portal to other internal systems, various external services relevant to employees&rsquo; daily work, and other collaboration sites.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Con Edison has embraced the fact that, in this industry at this time, like in other industries, winning in the marketplace starts with winning in the workplace,&rdquo; said Paul A. DeCotis, senior director and leader of West Monroe&rsquo;s East Coast Energy &amp; Utilities team. &ldquo;In our <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=8BA4A1103F564C5C84FA634269D35812&amp;_z=z\">recent study</a>, conducted by West Monroe, more than 60% of utility industry employees indicated their workplace technology needs at least some updating. Taking bold steps to modernize the workplace, as Con Edison has, not only strengthens operations today. It creates an environment that can attract the talent and emerging digital skills that utilities need for the future.<br />\n<br />\nNielsen Norman Group chose the winning intranets through an expert review, based on design and usability, from an international field of dozens of submissions.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>About West Monroe Partners</strong><br />\nWest Monroe is a national business and technology consulting firm that partners with dynamic organizations to reimagine, build, and operate their businesses at peak performance.

					"content": "<p>Chicago, Illinois- August 23, 2012 - West Monroe Partners, a full-service business and technology consultancy and managed service provider, and UbiStor, an IT managed solutions company, today announced the organizations will leverage their partnership to offer a complete disaster recovery solution as a service (DRaaS). The service will provide cloud infrastructure resources for recovery services to maintain and improve upon disaster recovery systems and processes. </p>\n<p>Together the firms will utilize UbiStor&rsquo;s infrastructure hosting capabilities for disaster recovery and West Monroe Partners&rsquo; IT DR process and testing capabilities to ensure maintenance of disaster recovery environments. UbiStor possesses core competencies that include data protection and management, tiered recovery, and hosting solutions. West Monroe Partners&rsquo; disaster recovery management and testing services help clients maintain up-to-date disaster recovery plans and processes as well as regular testing cycles. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;We see companies building disaster recovery environments but they lack the resources, process, maintenance and discipline required to sustain an effective disaster recovery environment over time,&rdquo; said Mark Nelson, West Monroe Partners&rsquo; director of managed services and IT outsourcing practice. &ldquo;Often times companies&rsquo; IT environments change and grow without considering their disaster recovery environments, which leads to the DR environment falling short of business requirements and decreasing in value.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;UbiStor&rsquo;s experience with data recovery and backup and our elastic and resilient disaster recovery environment position our current clients for recovery success in the event of a disaster,&rdquo; said David DiVito, UbiStor&rsquo;s channel account manager. &ldquo;Our joint offering brings organizations the benefit of knowing that their DR solution and processes run in lock-step with their business system solutions in a very operational and cost effective manner.&nbsp; This is a complete business continuity solution that covers all of the bases.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>This joint disaster recovery as a service will ensure a true disaster environment by proactively testing and keeping IT recovery documents current. West Monroe&rsquo;s disaster recovery services include incorporating new systems into disaster recovery infrastructure as they come online, conducting regular testing, remediating issues, updating disaster recovery documentation, and enhancing plans as hosting solutions evolve. These important components combined with UbiStor&rsquo;s virtual disaster recovery hosting provide customers options to rent and maintain a disaster recovery environment on demand on an as-needed-basis without a large capital investment. </p>\n<h2>About West Monroe Partners</h2>\n<p>\nWest Monroe Partners is an international, full-service business and technology consulting and managed services firm focused on guiding organizations through projects that fundamentally transform their business.

					"content": "<p>WEDNESDAY, SEPT. 15&mdash;Today West Monroe announced it is on track to be one of the fastest-growing digital consulting firms in the United States. In doing so, the firm revealed sizeable investments in digital consulting services, including a new global platform for digital product development as it focuses on helping clients become digital.<br />\n<br />\nUnlike other consulting firms, West Monroe believes <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=0B256C0E2EAD4832837C2A7A0BC59414&amp;_z=z\">digital transformation is a myth</a>&mdash;digital is not a project, a team, or a destination, it is instead a mindset and way of working. West Monroe continually moves clients closer to running a digital organization.<br />\n<br />\nThe $250 million investment in digital will cover the following:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>A global product development platform that creates the scale and efficiency needed to design, build, and manage digital products for Fortune 1000 and mid-market clients. The firm has aggressive acquisition plans for product development firms around the globe.</li>\n    <li>Training and skill-building programs for all West Monroe employees to deliver world-class digital consulting services for select industries.</li>\n    <li>Technology and assets that help West Monroe deliver faster, better consulting services to clients, including investments in its <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=641B188C4F1F412BB9D365D9B80B0FF1&amp;_z=z\">Intellio&reg; suite</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This represents the first time West Monroe has leveraged a global talent pool to serve North American clients.<br />\n<br />\nDriving the investment is outpaced demand for digital consulting services&nbsp;and specifically, the need for a consulting partner that helps companies deliver integrated experiences. According to Source Global Research, demand for digital consulting is growing at double the rate of traditional business consulting. West Monroe&rsquo;s sales in digital product consulting were 76% higher in the first half of 2021 compared to all of 2020.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Our new platform will leverage world-class product developers and managers, regardless of location, to create digital products for our clients,&rdquo; said Tom Bolger, chief strategy officer for West Monroe. &ldquo;This is exactly the kind of scale that&rsquo;s needed to execute the market-leading strategies designed by our product and experiences experts.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nCompanies are increasingly challenged to deliver customer-centric experiences that seamlessly integrate in-person and digital interactions and that are also backed up by agile, data-driven operations. West Monroe&rsquo;s unique approach to consulting is rooted in industry-led multidisciplinary teams that are fluent in digital. This includes industry experts who intimately understand the challenges and opportunities unique to a sector, functional experts who go deep in their craft, and technologists who are just as involved in the strategy as they are in execution. This approach is proving to be in high demand and leading the firm to post one of its strongest years on record. West Monroe is projecting 50% growth in revenue year over year.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Our clients increasingly compete and win based on their technology&mdash;a trend that existed before the pandemic but was certainly accelerated by it,&rdquo; said CEO <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=4D415E5E7A104990BE2F9291F0C4F49A&amp;_z=z\">Kevin McCarty</a>. &ldquo;With agile development and custom technology playing such a critical role to success, we&rsquo;re placing big bets to deliver on what we know our clients need to be successful with their digital mandates.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nPrevious acquisitions and corporate moves have been instrumental to reaching this point. In 2019, the acquisition of Minneapolis-based <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=2F12719C10964A018116A7E822147787&amp;_z=z\">GoKart Labs</a>&nbsp;incorporated digital products and experiences into the firm&rsquo;s technology-led services. The acquisitions of <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=40BF17F5FF31413F84162AAE09ACFBC9&amp;_z=z\">Waterstone</a>&nbsp;(2019) and <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=3C9C2AAFB07A4026A4272CF30FDD73EC&amp;_z=z\">Two Six Capital</a>&nbsp;(2020) added commercial growth and predictive analytics capabilities that help define growth for clients. And the addition of <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=C33A92838C1640CE9891C7B4DC73A771&amp;_z=z\">Pace Harmon</a>&nbsp;in 2020 deepened and widened the firm&rsquo;s capabilities in the IT strategy work that&rsquo;s necessary to transition from a traditional operating model to a digital operating model.<br />\n<br />\nThe current strategic move is a part of West Monroe&rsquo;s goal to become a $1 billion organization by 2025 and its imperative to help companies become digital.

We come together every day with the purpose of building a thriving organization, but let&rsquo;s face it: There is a big world beyond the walls of West Monroe Partners. We share a passion and commitment for making that world a better place.</p>\n<p>West Monroe Partners, a North American business and technology consulting firm, today announced that, through the efforts of its over 300 employees in seven offices in the United States and Canada, it donated more than 2,200 hours of pro-bono services in 2011 to projects that promote positive changes in its communities. Examples of these projects include equipping the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle to achieve its conservation and sustainability goals and developing new frameworks to support the City of Chicago&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan. </p>\n<p>These are among the early accomplishments of an ambitious new social and environmental responsibility commitment announced in early 2011. Following on the leadership efforts of its clients and business partners, West Monroe Partners set annual goals to contribute one percent of its talent in pro-bono work, one percent of its profits in donations to qualifying organizations, and one percent of its collective personnel time to community engagement and leadership activities.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Being stewards of our environment and the world is important to our people and, indeed, many of us have embraced this responsibility for years. A little over a year ago, we made the first significant change to our enterprise values in our almost 10 years of existence by adding a defined value around social responsibility,&rdquo; said Dean Fischer, West Monroe Partners&rsquo; president and CEO. &ldquo;We recognize that this is a very ambitious commitment, and we have a long way to go to achieve our goals, but we are proud of how our people have embraced this social commitment and opportunity. By maintaining and refining this commitment year over year, we can elevate the impact of our collective activities and help lead the important changes that need to happen in our communities.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Now in the second year of this program, the firm continues to see an increase in employee involvement. For example, employees in Chicago are participating in a city sponsored initiative to clean the Chicago River; employees in Canada are investing time and resources to improve facilities and set up computers and computer training for Auberge Madeleine, a community homeless shelter; and employees in Columbus are providing business expertise to support the Future Cities Competition State Finals, a national, project-based learning experience for middle-school students.<br />\n<br />\nIn addition, firm personnel have supplemented pro-bono community time by spending at least as many hours on internal practices to reduce waste and energy consumption. For example, the Chicago office has committed to more than a dozen green improvements through its involvement with Chicago&rsquo;s Green Office Challenge, as it designs, builds, and prepares to move into its new LEED-certified office space in Chicago. Through a Renewable Energy Credit program, the firm also has committed to procurement of 100-percent renewable energy in 2012 and 2013 to power all offices.</p>\n<p>In 2011, West Monroe Partners also matched nearly 500 hours of time spent by employees on qualified community service activities so that employees could devote additional hours to these pursuits while on the job. The firm also contributed more than $100,000 to community organizations across its six markets.<br />\n<strong></strong></p>\n<h2 sizcache=\"2\" sizset=\"64\">About West Monroe Partners</h2>\n<p sizcache=\"2\" sizset=\"64\">West Monroe Partners is a North American, full-service business and technology consulting firm focused on guiding organizations through projects that fundamentally transform their business.

					"content": "<p>West Monroe Partners, a full-service North American business and technology consultancy, today announced the appointment of five new directors across the firm: Carl Monje, Tom Racciatti, Jill Schubmehl, Munzoor Shaikh, and Zach Jones.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As a people-first organization, we are extremely diligent about evaluating and recognizing those who have accepted the challenge to become leaders within their respective areas of expertise,&rdquo; said Kevin McCarty, CEO and president of West Monroe Partners. &ldquo;The combination of exceptional individual performance and the ability to create and capitalize on business opportunity are the defining characteristics of our incoming directors. Additionally, these new directors have proven to be steadfast in their dedication to building and mentoring teams, securing the legacy of West Monroe as a place where the very best want to join and build long-term careers.&rdquo; </p>\n<p><strong>Carl Monje</strong> joined West Monroe in April 2010 and in nearly five years since then has taken an active leadership role in the firm&rsquo;s Mergers &amp; Acquisitions practice. Monje serves as a strategic advisor to middle-market corporate executives and leading private equity investors and has supported more than 100 merger, acquisition, or carve-out transactions. In January 2015, Monje transferred to the firm&rsquo;s Los Angeles office to lead growth and development of the Mergers &amp; Acquisitions practice in Southern California and on the West Coast. As director, Monje will focus on building market presence, growing a local and national client base, and developing a team to support West Monroe&rsquo;s growth in that region. </p>\n<p><strong>Tom Racciatti</strong> joined West Monroe in March 2013 as a senior manager and was one of the first employees in the firm&rsquo;s Minneapolis office. A leader of that office&rsquo;s Operations Excellence team with a deep focus on supply chain operations, Tom has played a critical role in the Minneapolis office&rsquo;s rapid growth. Racciatti is committed to innovation within the market and is highly involved in building a cost-to-serve &ldquo;supply chain strategy&rdquo; methodology. As director, Racciatti&rsquo;s priorities and focus for 2015 will be expanding the Minneapolis office client base, and providing leadership and expertise for taking innovative supply chain solutions to market. </p>\n<p><strong>Jill Schubmehl</strong> joined West Monroe nearly 10 years ago from Hewitt Associates. As a member of West Monroe&rsquo;s Customer Experience practice, Jill has been at the forefront of that team&rsquo;s evolution and capabilities&mdash;from SharePoint and digital user experience, to customer experience transformation and program management offices (PMOs). She has earned a reputation as an accomplished leader with a track record for delivering successful, complex solutions that enhance customer experience. Schubmehl is currently leading a large transformation project designed to improve customers&rsquo; and employees&rsquo; experience. As director, she will continue to build West Monroe&rsquo;s PMO methodology for managing complex programs, as well as guiding development of assets and tools that can accelerate delivery of solutions. </p>\n<p><strong>Munzoor Shaikh</strong> joined West Monroe in October 2005 and is a member of the Healthcare practice. He has more than 14 years of experience in management and technology consulting and is responsible for leading transformative programs for West Monroe's healthcare clients. He helps clients capitalize on market opportunities and navigate evolving regulation, such as the Affordable Care Act, which has forced payers and providers to cut costs and improve quality and clinical outcomes and resulted in complex change and merger and acquisition activity throughout the industry. Shaikh will continue leading West Monroe&rsquo;s efforts in this area, improving the firm&rsquo;s ability to deliver technology- and process-enabled transformation as well as to execute effective mergers and acquisitions and drive meaningful use of data. </p>\n<p><strong>Zach Jones</strong> joined West Monroe in September 2011 as a senior manager on the firm&rsquo;s Finance &amp; Accounting team. Since then, Jones has been intricately involved in virtually every major business initiative, from the firm&rsquo;s conversion to an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) to acquisitions to improved financial reporting and forecasting that enable more effective and efficient operations. Jones also has served as the interim CFO, participating on executive team and board activities and providing leadership on matters related to finances and firm direction. In addition, he has recruited, mentored, and developed members of the Finance &amp; Accounting team, enabling the team to elevate its performance. </p>\n<p>\nAll appointments and promotions were effective March 1st, 2015.</p>",

Now in its ninth year, the Fischer Global Service Fellowship Program provides West Monroe employees up to six months of leave to volunteer their time and talent to support a philanthropic and humanitarian issue of interest, anywhere in the world.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The four new Fischer Fellows join 28 other West Monroe professionals who previously completed fellowships, supporting causes that include literacy, clean water, gender equity, mental/behavioral health, economic empowerment, infrastructure development, human trafficking prevention, and more. Fischer Fellows have served on almost all continents and in their local communities. In 2020 and 2021, the Fischer Fellowship was paused due to the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Congratulations to this new group of outstanding Fischer Fellows, who strive to make the world a better and more equitable place.

To support their clean energy transition through solar energy and microgrid development, she conducted current state assessments of energy insecurity in the community, analyzed solar net metering trends in Puerto Rico, and enhanced organizational design to support microgrid operations and social reinvestment.&nbsp;</li>\n    <li><strong>Iman Kialeuka-Tiya</strong>, a senior consultant in the Operations Excellence practice in New York (originally a 2020 fellow and delayed due to the pandemic), returned from volunteering with an organization in New York City aimed at eliminating employment barriers for immigrant and refugee professionals in the United States by upskilling based on their interest and connecting them with employer partners. Iman improved supervisor engagement following their project management software implementation, supported the establishment of internal and external communications strategies, and connected with recently arrived immigrants to provide guidance and support as they seek to join the workforce. She continues to volunteer with the organization in several capacities including the project management of a financial management workshop.</li>\n    <li>\n    <p><strong>Theresa Miller</strong>, a senior consultant in the Energy &amp; Utilities practice in Chicago, is volunteering in Nome, Alaska with Norton Sound Health Corporation's (NSHC) community utility assistance program to address sanitation needs in the Bering Strait region. The program's vision is to secure access to safe and affordable water/wastewater systems for all 15 communities by 2030. She is establishing utility emergency response plans, developing regulatory compliance dashboards, launching a regionwide home sanitation needs assessment, and designing a centralized grant management strategy.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p><strong>Sarah Reynolds</strong>, a senior consultant in the Healthcare &amp; Life Sciences practice in Seattle, will be working with a Washington D.C. based organization that partners with local leaders and organizations around the world to improve their local community health, access to education, and climate resiliency to improve individual livelihoods and promote more inclusive governance. She will leverage her program management and strategic transformation experiences to support their women-specific initiatives that provides unique mentorship and aid to individual female business owners in developing nations who do not have access to learning and networking opportunities.</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>&ldquo;We are excited to announce another fantastic class of Fischer Fellows.

Not only do the Fellows return to West Monroe having made an impact on the organizations and communities they served, but they return as more well-rounded leaders.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Employees interested in pursuing a Fischer Fellowship are required to develop a comprehensive proposal, which includes vetting an organization to work with and creating a proposal detailing a budget and expected impact. A West Monroe committee solicits and reviews the proposals annually and awards selected applicants with fellowship opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Fischer Global Service Fellowship is one component of West Monroe&rsquo;s core value of social responsibility, combining community focused, large-scale programs with grassroots, employee-led efforts to support the causes most important to both our people and our communities.

The research findings and outcomes identify 12 skill sector and associated competency levels required in a smart grid enabled utility and have led to the development of job competency profiles, which are used to define and integrate necessary education and training.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As smart grid and restructuring transform the utility industry, the research done by the Illinois Institute of Technology and West Monroe Partners - under a grant provide by the United States Department of Energy, identified a critical need for utilities to transform not only the technologies that drive its business, but the competencies and skills of its current and future workforce as well&rdquo; says Dr. Mohammad Shahidehpour, Carl Bodine Distinguished Professor and Director of the Robert W. Galvin Center for Electricity Innovation at the Illinois Institute of Technology. &ldquo;I am pleased to see that the talented consultants of West Monroe Partners will be helping our utilities and smart grid vendors create their Workforce Of the Future plans. Without these plans in place, utilities will not be able to realize the full benefits of a smarter grid.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>This initial research has been further expanded by West Monroe Partners to focus on near-term and longer-term organizational changes in the utility environment. The shortage of engineering and technical talent in the utility industry is compounded by the addition of new technologies and accelerated attrition due to the retiring Baby Boomer generation. This perfect storm of external pressures is creating challenges and opportunities for the utility industry. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Utilities and their stakeholders can leverage the full benefits of grid modernization by transforming their organizations to mirror the convergence of energy delivery, telecommunications, IT systems, and customer choice,&rdquo; says Sr. Principal Jack Winter with West Monroe. &ldquo;I look forward to providing utilities the strategies, tools, and methodologies they need to effectively develop and manage their workforce.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>With the addition of this offering, West Monroe continues to meet the growing needs of its utility clients.

					"content": "<p>West Monroe Partners, a full-service North American business and technology consultancy, today announced the appointment of co-founder and President Kevin McCarty to the role of CEO, effective October 1st . Dean Fischer, who served as CEO since co-founding the firm in 2002, assumes the role of executive chairman of the firm&rsquo;s Board of Managers.</p>\n<p>As executive chairman, Fischer will participate in board duties, including setting objectives for and appraising performance of the CEO. He will also remain involved on a part-time basis in selective activities related to strategic growth, legal affairs, finance, and other advisory needs related to client relationships, global alliances, business development and related matters.</p>\n<p>McCarty, West Monroe Partners&rsquo; president since 2012, assumes the additional responsibilities of CEO, including establishing the firm&rsquo;s strategic direction, overseeing the successful execution of that strategy, maintaining the firm&rsquo;s unique culture and maximizing long term financial returns to its employee owners through the firm&rsquo;s Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP).</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Dean has inspired so many to become better leaders through his enthusiasm, passion, and commitment to the people and world around him. &rdquo; said McCarty. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had the great fortune of learning from an exceptional leader as I&rsquo;ve developed my career, and it&rsquo;s both an honor and a tremendous responsibility to take the reigns from him. I look forward to working with Dean and our board to continue shaping the firm that we first sketched out on a napkin a dozen years ago.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For nearly 40 years, Fischer has been a professional services industry leader and entrepreneur. Under his direction, West Monroe Partners has grown from a handful of employees in 2002 to a full-service consultancy with 10 offices across North America and a complement of more than 500 consultants. More importantly, he has made his mark as a recruiter, leader, teacher, and motivator of people&mdash;playing a central role in defining and maintaining a unique, people-oriented culture that has earned West Monroe Partners numerous accolades, along with a strong client and employee base. He has been instrumental in building many of the firm&rsquo;s client and alliance relationships. </p>\n<p>Fischer spent the majority of his career with Arthur Andersen, where he became known as an entrepreneur with a legacy of rapid service and business development. He combines his passions for sustainability and corporate citizenship into leadership in the community, including serving as a board member of the Student Conservation Association for seven years and now serves on the Boards of Audubon Chicago Region and Openlands.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Building a firm of the character, stature, and reputation of today&rsquo;s West Monroe Partners from the ground up, of course, has been very gratifying. But even more than that, it has been tremendously fun,&rdquo; said Fischer. &ldquo;It is particularly rewarding to see our people grow and develop into strong leaders&mdash;and nowhere is that more apparent than in the leadership that Kevin McCarty is bringing, not only to our firm but to our clients and our profession. I&rsquo;m excited to see where Kevin and our other leaders can take West Monroe Partners in the years ahead.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>McCarty also has played a critical leadership role in West Monroe Partners&rsquo; growth. His vision and leadership has helped evolve the organization from one known for technology competence into a true management consulting organization with a strong reputation for guiding clients through complex transformational business changes. Consulting&reg; magazine named him one of its 2013 Top 25 Consultants in the Excellence in Leadership category. Prior to co-founding West Monroe Partners in 2002, McCarty spent eight years with Arthur Andersen in Chicago as a senior manager in the firm&rsquo;s Business Consulting practice. McCarty also sits on the board of HFS Chicago Scholars. <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=4D415E5E7A104990BE2F9291F0C4F49A&amp;_z=z\">(Full biography here)</a>.</p>",

In this role, he will be responsible for all operating offices and internal shared services. </p>\n<p>Dean Fischer, who has served as West Monroe Partners&rsquo; President and CEO since the firm&rsquo;s founding in 2002, will retain the title and responsibilities of Chairman &amp; CEO and will focus on strategic matters, business development, and key client and partner relationships, including the firm&rsquo;s international alliance with BearingPoint in Europe.</p>\n<p>McCarty co-founded West Monroe Partners with Fischer and several others in 2002, and since then he has played an integral role in the firm&rsquo;s growth. Prior to becoming President, McCarty was the firm&rsquo;s Executive Vice President and Chicago office lead.&nbsp; Under his leadership, the Chicago office has grown 250 percent in the past five years and to a team of more than 200 consultants today. </p>\n<p>He also has developed several critical industry and functional capabilities for West Monroe Partners, including guiding the firm&rsquo;s Private Equity practice from a fledgling offering to a nationally recognized practice that today serves more than 70 leading private equity firms. Over time, West Monroe has applied those capabilities to support more than 400 transactions with a combined value of over $50 billion.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;One of the most difficult leadership positions to hold is one within a professional services organization, where the key asset is intelligent, highly motivated people, who share a fair amount of self-confidence. This type of environment requires a natural selection process that produces leaders acknowledged by all as the right person for the job,&rdquo; said Fischer. &ldquo;We did not select Kevin McCarty as our next President simply because he co-founded our company. We selected him based on his track record for innovation, practice development, client service and, most importantly, for the respect that he has earned from those around him&mdash;from his peers to our newest team members.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Prior to joining West Monroe Partners, McCarty was with Arthur Andersen&rsquo;s Business Consulting practice in Chicago. He previously developed technical depth in infrastructure and software development through various other technology products and IT services organizations. </p>\n<p>Kevin earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration and Management of Information Systems from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is active in various non-profit organizations in the Chicago area, including HFS Chicago Scholars and The Hope Institute for Children and Families.</p>",

In order to bring this value to life, West Monroe developed multiple programs designed to give back to their communities though a 1+1+1 program. The program allows employees to give back to their communities through contributing one percent of their talent in pro-bono work, one percent of their profits in donations to qualifying organizations, and one percent of their collective personnel time to community engagement and leadership activities.</p>\n<p>In conjunction with adding Social Responsibility to its charter a few years ago, West Monroe Partners also sought LEED certification for its new 15,612 square foot state-of-the-art Seattle office.</p>\n<p>In designing and constructing its new Seattle office space, West Monroe Partners took a variety of steps to reduce energy consumption and impact on the environment:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p>98 percent of the office has occupancy sensors, part of an energy reduction strategy designed to consume less energy</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>36.8 percent less lighting power</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>100 percent of the appliances and equipment purchased are Energy Star rated</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>Installed fixtures that will reduce water use by 35.2 percent</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>More than 79 percent of construction waste was recycled, reused, or diverted, preventing it from going to landfills</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>The office offset 100% of its electricity consumption with green power</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>&ldquo;When we drew up the plans to design a new office space, our commitment to build an environmentally friendly and sustainable space was at the forefront of our goals,&rdquo; said Tom Bolger, Managing Director of West Monroe&rsquo;s Seattle office. &ldquo;I'm very proud that we were able to build such a collaborative and functional office for our growing team that minimizes its footprint on the environment.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nMore than 54,000 projects are currently participating in the commercial and institutional LEED rating systems, comprising over 10.1 billion square feet of construction space in all 50 states and 120 countries. LEED guidelines are designed to reduce energy consumption, emissions, water use, and consumption of natural resources. West Monroe Partners Seattle office achieved LEED certification for implementing practical and measurable strategies and solutions aimed at achieving high performance in: sustainable site development, water savings, energy efficiency, materials selection and indoor environmental quality. <br />\n<br />\n\"With each new LEED-certified building, we get one step closer to USGBC's vision of a sustainable built environment within a generation,\" said Rick Fedrizzi, President, CEO &amp; Founding Chair, U.S. Green Building Council. \"As the newest member of the LEED family of green buildings, West Monroe Partners is an important addition to the growing strength of the green building movement.\"</p>",

					"content": "<p>CHICAGO &ndash; Nov. 16, 2018 &ndash; West Monroe Partners, a national business and technology consulting firm, announced it is hosting a national celebration today for its employees in honor of the firm&rsquo;s 26 awards won in 2018.</p>\n<p>Each of the firm&rsquo;s nine offices across the United States is hosting a breakfast celebration on the same day to demonstrate solidarity and appreciation for each other&rsquo;s efforts and results in 2018.Each year, West Monroe wins a number of workplace awards for its company culture. In 2018, distinctions spanned national awards, such as the Best Places to Work for Millennials, to local awards, such as Washington&rsquo;s Best Places to Work, to individual honors, such as the Women Leaders in Consulting award, this year bestowed upon Jodi Bednar, a director in West Monroe&rsquo;s Energy &amp; Utilities practice.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n&ldquo;Culture has always been a top priority for West Monroe Winning 26 awards in 2018 validates the hard work that every employee-owner at West Monroe puts into this company,&rdquo; said Susan Stelter, Chief People Officer for West Monroe. &ldquo;I am grateful to have our people-first values be recognized by so many esteemed awards programs, but it&rsquo;s even more important to me that we are fulfilling our mission of building the next generation of leaders and creating an environment for employees to learn and grow.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMost of the awards in 2018 were won through employee satisfaction and engagement surveys, conducted by various third-party organizations. One of the firm&rsquo;s leading values, &ldquo;people first,&rdquo; has driven client satisfaction and project success over the years. The firm&rsquo;s leadership believes employees do their best work when they are fulfilled and their contributions are realized, which is why the company is 100% employee-owned and operates an employee stock ownership plan.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWest Monroe serves hundreds of clients across the mid-market and Fortune 1000, and its employees have fueled incredible growth. The firm was founded in 2002 and has grown at a CAGR of 35%. It currently employs more than 1,000 people across nine U.S. offices. In mid-2017, the firm announced plans to double its workforce by 2022 as part of an effort to address today&rsquo;s growing tech skills gap in business and innovation.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n&ldquo;Having an award-winning culture means we can consistently retain and attract top talent to best serve our clients. What is so fulfilling to me is that these awards are not only won at a national level, but also at the local level in nearly all of our markets &ndash; meaning the culture permeates across the entire company, whether you work in Seattle, Los Angeles, New York, or one of our other six offices,&rdquo; said <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=4D415E5E7A104990BE2F9291F0C4F49A&amp;_z=z\">Kevin McCarty</a>, President &amp; CEO of West Monroe. &ldquo;We put a ton of work into creating that consistency, and these awards prove that a company culture built on values will sustain and prosper no matter which city you&rsquo;re in or how much you grow.&rdquo;</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.channele2e.com/top100/msp-list-2018/8/\" target=\"_blank\">ChannelE2E - Top 100 Vertical Market MSPs List 2018</a></li>\n    <li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/careers/topworkplaces2018/ct-top-workplaces-searchable-chart-2018-htmlstory.html\" target=\"_blank\">Chicago Tribune&rsquo;s Top Workplaces 2018</a></li>\n    <li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://www.consultingmag.com/2018/03/13/the-2018-rising-stars-of-the-profession-35-under-35/\" target=\"_blank\">Consulting Magazine&rsquo;s Rising Stars of the Profession - Jordan Sternlieb</a></li>\n    <li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://www.consultingmag.com/2018/03/13/the-2018-rising-stars-of-the-profession-35-under-35/\" target=\"_blank\">Consulting Magazine&rsquo;s Rising Stars of the Profession - Kevin Hulsebosch</a></li>\n    <li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.westmonroe.com/News/Press-Releases/2018/11/Jodi-Bednar-Women-Leaders-in-Consulting\" target=\"_blank\">Consulting Magazine&rsquo;s Women Leaders in Consulting - Jodi Bednar</a></li>\n    <li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20180412/ISSUE01/180419965/the-best-large-companies-to-work-for-in-chicago\" target=\"_blank\">Crain&rsquo;s Chicago - Best Places to Work 2018 &ndash;

					"content": "<p>CHICAGO &ndash; West Monroe Partners, a national business and technology consultancy, announced it is hosting a national celebration for employees in honor of the 35 awards it received in 2019 for its people-first company culture. The firm&rsquo;s employees are gathering for breakfast tomorrow morning in each of its nine offices across the United States to demonstrate appreciation for each other&rsquo;s efforts and to commemorate the recognition received during 2019.</p>\n<p>West Monroe&rsquo;s 2019 accolades include an array of national awards, best-workplace recognition in many of its local markets, and individual honors for several consultants and leaders. Many of the awards are based on feedback from employee satisfaction and engagement surveys conducted by various third-party organizations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n&ldquo;We started West Monroe with the purpose of creating a different type of consulting organization that puts people first. That principle has guided everything we have done since, from creating a model of 100% employee ownership to defining our mission to be about building the next generation of leaders,&rdquo; said Susan Stelter, West Monroe&rsquo;s chief people officer. &ldquo;It has been extremely gratifying to see that initial vision come to life as an organization widely recognized for being a &lsquo;best place to work.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMost recently, West Monroe earned the No. 26 spot on the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.greatplacetowork.com/best-workplaces/parents/2019\" target=\"_blank\">Great Place to Work&reg;/FORTUNE list of Best Workplaces for Parents</a>, marking the firm&rsquo;s first appearance on that list. The award reflects West Monroe&rsquo;s recent investment in updated family-friendly policies and programs &ndash; including increased parental leave for both primary and secondary caregivers, flexible work arrangements, flexible time off, alternative travel, and a new backup care offering &ndash; designed to benefit all employees, not just parents.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOther new awards in 2019 include The Brandon Hall Group&rsquo;s Bronze Award for Excellence in Sales Performance, the Serve Illinois Governor&rsquo;s Volunteer Service Award, and two best-workplaces awards in Dallas.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWest Monroe has grown from a 2002 startup to a firm of more than 1,400 employees across the United States. In 2017, the firm announced plans to double its workforce by 2022 as part of an effort to address today&rsquo;s growing technology skills gap in business and innovation.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Culture is and always has been a top priority and something that guides our strategy and operations,&rdquo; said <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=4D415E5E7A104990BE2F9291F0C4F49A&amp;_z=z\">Kevin McCarty,</a>&nbsp;president and CEO. &ldquo;These various marketplace awards make me proud and shows we don&rsquo;t just pay lip service to people and culture. As we continue to bring our mission of building the next generation of leaders to life, our people tell us it resonates and feels &lsquo;real&rsquo; and inspiring.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nFollowing are among West Monroe&rsquo;s 2019 awards and recognition:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=875F3526559A48C8B5B4276526B8091F&amp;_z=z\">Brandon Hall Group: Bronze award for excellence in the Best Program for Sales Training and Performance category</a>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    Business Relationship Management Institute: 2019 Top Business Relationship Management Professional &ndash;

As part of a consortium that also included the Civic Consulting Alliance, City of Chicago, Chicago Park District, IIT Galvin Center for Electricity Innovation, Illinois Science &amp; Technology Coalition, and the Citizens Utility Board, West Monroe Partners played a key leading role in the development of the strategic Master Energy Roadmap for the institution. <br />\n<br />\nShedd Aquarium, a leading global conservation and education organization, aims to cut energy consumption of the 83-year-old historic building in half by 2020, saving 10 million kilowatt hours annually&mdash;enough to power 750 households. <br />\n<br />\nDevelopment of the project roadmap, which completed the first phase of the long-term initiative, produced an assessment of the institution&rsquo;s current energy profile, evaluated 24 specific areas of opportunity, and created a comprehensive structure and process for management and implementation. Key findings identified include the use of real-time and consumption-point data intelligence to optimize operational and equipment energy use, as well as significant tools and technologies that could potentially decrease energy consumption, just to name a few. <br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;We are pleased to have this opportunity to contribute some of West Monroe Partners&rsquo; core skills and our time&mdash;not only to benefit one of Chicago&rsquo;s most iconic cultural institutions, but also to promote the development and benefit of strategies that have a meaningful impact on our environment and our community,&rdquo; said Tom Hulsebosch, director of West Monroe&rsquo;s Utility and Smart Energy practice. &ldquo;The output of this work provides Shedd Aquarium with clear direction for advancing its goals.&rdquo; <br />\n<br />\nOther elements of the Master Energy Roadmap include advanced intelligence, energy efficiency, automation and control, energy storage, and on-site renewable generation. The Master Energy Roadmap will guide the institution&rsquo;s implementation effort. <br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;West Monroe&rsquo;s expertise in smart energy technologies and their leadership in helping to create a savvy coalition of partners with the advanced knowledge to analyze our complex needs and considerations were extraordinary,&rdquo; said Robert Wengel, vice president of facilities for Shedd. &ldquo;This project is an important and vital part of our work to meet the primary goals of providing clean and reliable habitats for the animals in our care, identifying energy efficiencies and lowering expenditures where possible, achieving and maintaining a more sustainable supply of power, and creating opportunities that educate our guests about the responsibility of conservation.&rdquo; <br />\n<br />\nIn early 2011, West Monroe Partners announced an ambitious social and environmental responsibility commitment.

Company boards are also rethinking their long-term talent workforce strategies as they seek resilience in the face of future challenges and crises.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nIn response to market needs, West Monroe has launched <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=22F0C760A04840549287532CD083F590&amp;_z=z\">Strategic Workforce Optimization with Work 4D</a>. The multidisciplinary solution combines core West Monroe disciplines to solve talent issues by analyzing work across the organization and aligning the work with the talent type best suited to deliver it: <strong>employees, contractors, outsourcers, or automation</strong>. Companies that align work to optimal talent type typically achieve 30% to 40% lower costs, while driving higher revenue, greater scalability, and improved employee satisfaction. West Monroe has delivered components of the solution dozens of times in the last 18 months, specializing in Fortune 500 clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here are just some of the major workforce challenges companies face:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>A global shortage of talent:</strong> Today, there are approximately 4.6 million more job openings in the U.S. than workers available to fill them.<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>It is projected that by 2030, the world will have 85 million open roles.<sup>2</sup></li>\n    <li><strong>An exodus of talent: </strong>33% of companies are seeing higher-than-expected turnover in employees with valued digital skills.<sup>3</sup></li>\n    <li><strong>A skills gap: </strong>98% of companies report significant skill gaps. HR and risk managers alike rank skills obsolescence as a top-10 risk.<sup>4</sup></li>\n    <li><strong>Unrealized revenue:</strong> By 2030, the inability to fill open roles will cost global firms over $8.5 billion in potential revenue.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&ldquo;The need for greater workforce flexibility and resiliency has reached a tipping point as companies have navigated the pandemic, remote and hybrid work, inflation, and layoffs. But it&rsquo;s not just companies that seek more stability&mdash;employees want it, too,&rdquo; said <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=138F7D55B5A14438A584D42C3EF948A4&amp;_z=z\">Casey Foss</a>, West Monroe&rsquo;s chief commercial officer.&nbsp;</p>",

The firm&rsquo;s more than 300 technology professionals, covering disciplines such as cybersecurity, digital solutions, cloud computing, application development, and infrastructure, have come together under one practice in response to the market&rsquo;s growing needs for solving tough business challenges through a technology lens. To support these market needs, West Monroe also announced that it is developing a technology hub within its Dallas office.</p>\n<p>West Monroe&rsquo;s ability to deliver technology expertise with a business mindset has been a driving force behind the firm&rsquo;s 35% compound annual growth rate. Founded in 2002, West Monroe currently employs more than 1,000 people across 10 offices nationwide. Last year, the firm announced plans to double its workforce by 2022, in large part to address a growing technology skills gap in business. Investing in technology talent has helped the firm make progress on this goal, hiring hundreds nationwide over the last 12 months.</p>\n<p>\n&ldquo;We have found that mastering the shift in today&rsquo;s rapidly evolving business environment requires doing several things very well &ndash; from tapping into actionable data to building a modern platform and securing the business. Each of these &lsquo;dimensions&rsquo; relies on diverse technological competencies, but companies gain the greatest value when they address them in concert rather than as separate initiatives,&rdquo; said Greg Layok, managing director of technology at West Monroe. &ldquo;We have made great strides in building teams with world-class talent in essential technology disciplines. Making sure these technologists are part of a consolidated, collaborative development center environment increases their ability to address complex business challenges with speed and innovation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>While many consultancies provide technology services from remote locations, West Monroe has maintained an onshore approach to building its technology team and locating IT consultants in its offices, where they have the opportunity to collaborate with colleagues in other disciplines to build technology-enabled business solutions. &ldquo;An uncommon blend of business consulting acumen and deep technology expertise is at the heart of what differentiates West Monroe in the consulting marketplace,&rdquo; Layok said. &ldquo;That blend is possible because our technologists are in our offices, working side-by-side every day with industry and other business specialists.</p>\n<p>\nWest Monroe now has established technology leaders and consultants in all its offices.

These services balance a need for investing in infrastructure while supporting increased customer service expectations.</p>\n<p>To assist water utilities with increasing customer demands, bad debt, water leakage, an aging infrastructure and workforce, and billing inaccuracy issues, West Monroe Partners has developed an offering that helps water utilities tackle these challenges. West Monroe Partners works with water utilities to optimize processes, identify the right technologies, and position its workforce to leverage the new technology and processes. A key component of West Monroe&rsquo;s methodology is creating a culture of measurement and continuous improvement. West Monroe Partners has found that identifying key performance indicators for processes such as customer payment delinquency rates or number of billing exceptions--along with goals for improvement bring the necessary focus, employee engagement, and accountability to enable sustainable improvements.</p>\n<p>West Monroe Partners is currently helping multiple water utilities address these challenges while they transform their organizations. These transformations start with a strategic plan that includes the business case, approach, technology roadmap, and identifies the organizational impacts the utility will face. The results of many of these projects address key issues, improve service levels, reduce bad debt and improve employee engagement for clients.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Transformation is something that every utility should be thinking about right now. Evolving expectations have placed a high demand on customer experience and meter operations but utilities are struggling to keep up &ndash; both financially and operationally. Many utilities aren&rsquo;t sure how to tackle this problem, but we believe that creating a strategic customer service transformation plan is an important initial step. In addition to a strong ROI, we believe that offering a great customer experience is necessary to meet today&rsquo;s challenging customer expectations. We are excited for what the future holds for this market and look forward to helping our utility clients achieve their strategic vision,&rdquo; said Tom Hulsebosch, managing director of West Monroe&rsquo;s Energy &amp; Utilities Practice.</p>\n<p>West Monroe has completed a benchmark study on credit &amp; collection practices of electric and water utilities by surveying many different utility types and sizes. This study has culminated in a collection of credit &amp; collection best practices that utilities can use to reduce risk, enhance revenue protection, and improve the overall customer experience. The white paper highlighting the findings can be found by clicking on this link.</p>\n<p>For more information reach out to Tom Hulsebosch or Dave Tilson, director, business consulting.</p>",

The build-out coincides with the firm&rsquo;s Managed Services practice expansion and re-branding. The team&rsquo;s operations occupy a new 8,000 square-foot space, adding to its current office space bringing the total footprint to 50,000 sq ft. </p>\n<p>West Monroe has opted to build out its new space in the loop in an effort to keep its Managed Services practice close to the rest of its consulting team. This environment offers better collaboration across internal teams and to the clients they serve. </p>\n<p>West Monroe views &ldquo;managed services&rdquo; very differently and believes strong, efficiently run core systems are the foundation on which a business endures, grows and innovates. When run well, businesses are better positioned to achieve and exceed business objectives. The practice provides clients application &amp; data management, as well as core data center operations supported by a service desk focused on outstanding customer experience. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Our Managed&nbsp;Services team partners with clients to break down barriers between their IT organization and business teams to deliver high-quality programs, efficiently,&rdquo; said Nate Ulery, Senior Director of Performance Services. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an exciting time to oversee our thriving Managed&nbsp;Services team and enable them to wear many gloves to ensure systems and processes are running at peak performance and customer service is exceeding expectations.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Most companies invest in call centers in remote areas. We took a different approach by adding state of the art space in downtown Chicago because we are paying top dollar to attract and retain top-tier technologists,&rdquo; said Kevin McCarty, CEO and President of West Monroe Partners. </p>\n<p>West Monroe Partners&rsquo; Managed&nbsp;Services practice has received a number of service accolades including the recent MSPmentor 200 North American Edition list. Mark Nelson, Director of Managed&nbsp;&nbsp;Services&nbsp; was recently selected for the seventh annual MSPmentor 250 by Penton Technology Group. &nbsp; </p>\n<p>\nWest Monroe Partners, with a team of more than 400 in Chicago, including over 70 in its Managed&nbsp;Services practice alone, leased the space through 2023 to accommodate its projected future growth. </p>\n<p>\nThe Chicago office, which opened in 2002, serves more than 400 clients in key industries, including banking, private equity, life sciences, insurance, utilities, and retail.</p>",

Divided into two categories, Small (25-100 employees) and Medium (101-999 employees), the list has recognized companies with exceptional workplace cultures for the past twelve years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>West Monroe Partners won this accolade based on employees' anonymous responses to an extensive survey about their levels of trust, pride and camaraderie at work. Great Place to Work&reg; reviewed the survey results of more than 52,000 employees from hundreds of companies in the ranking process. Among the findings from the study: trust fuels business performance. The Best Small and Medium Workplaces not only provide a better experience for their people, but also enjoy roughly three times the revenue growth of their peers.</p>\n<p>\n&ldquo;Winning this award is more than just adding another plaque on our awards wall or social media post &ndash; winning this award means we continue to foster an environment that is challenging to our people, putting them first as we build the next generation of leaders,&rdquo; said Kevin McCarty, CEO and co-founder of West Monroe. &ldquo;We are extremely proud of the culture we have built &ndash; and that we&rsquo;ve been successful maintaining it as we grow.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a generosity of spirit that infuses the Best Small and Medium workplaces&mdash;one that has a measurable return,&rdquo; said Kim Peters, Executive Vice President of Great Place to Work. &ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s funding employee &lsquo;passion projects&rsquo; or giving surprise gifts to customers, the best workplaces give it away.

Employees completed our anonymous Trust Index&copy; survey, answering questions about how frequently they experience the behaviors that create a great workplace, including, for example, their assessment of the honesty and quality of communication by managers, degree of support for employees' personal and professional lives and the authenticity of relationships with colleagues.</p>\n<p>Results from the survey are highly reliable, having a 95% confidence level and a margin of error of 5% or less. Winning a spot on this list indicates the company has distinguished itself from peers by creating a great place to work for all &ndash; not only do the majority of their employees experience the company as a great place to work, but this experience is consistent across the organization, regardless of gender, race/ethnicity, job role, or other personal characteristics. The companies with the highest employee ratings compared with organizations of the same complexity in size and scope were selected for the list. Companies with fewer than 100 employees compete for placement on the 50 Best Small Workplaces list, and companies between 100 and 999 employees compete for placement on the 100 Best Medium Workplaces list.</p>",

It is a privilege to represent our profession on this list of leaders in promoting wellness in the workplace, and we are particularly proud that it is the grassroots efforts of our people that have positioned our firm for such recognition.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>West Monroe Partners&rsquo; Wellness Committee, with 20 members across all firm offices, creates and oversees initiatives that help employees thrive in the intensive consulting lifestyle. For example, recent committee initiatives have included a virtual marathon (step competition), group yoga class followed by juice &ldquo;happy hour&rdquo; in the office, and a guest speaker to teach employees how to maximize return on investment in wellness efforts. The Wellness Committee is a product of West Monroe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Chiefs&rdquo; program, which encourages employees to volunteer to create and run a committee around an area of interest.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Each year we create a roadmap that aims to educate, engage, and empower our people in wellness-related activities,&rdquo; said Tory Loebig, a Chicago-based consultant who chairs the Wellness Committee. &ldquo;From initial small changes such asking employees to visibly schedule walking meetings on their calendars to competitive fitness challenges among hundreds of employees, we see interest in creating healthy workplaces and communities continuing to grow.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Founded in 2002 in Chicago, West Monroe Partners has grown to 11 offices across the United States and more than 800 consultants. It has received numerous national and regional accolades for its workplace and human resource practices.</p>\n<p>The Best and Brightest in Wellness&reg;, a program of the National Association for Business Resources, is presented annually. The 2016 list of companies recognized as Best and Brightest in Wellness&reg; includes 14 wellness providers and 62 employers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The 2016 winning companies were evaluated by an assessment, created and administered by SynBella, the nation&rsquo;s leading wellness firm. The evaluation process statistically examined entries&rsquo; quantitative data on a criteria-based point system to benchmark and improve wellness program effectiveness. These criteria include outcomes, analysis and tracking, participation and incentives, benefits and programs, leadership, employee input, culture, and environment.</p>",

This is the firm&rsquo;s third consecutive appearance on the list. West Monroe Partners ranked 24th overall, and&nbsp; earned top-10 rankings in eight specific &ldquo;Quality of Life&rdquo; criteria: green policies (3rd), hours (6th), firm culture (7th), philanthropy (7th), satisfaction (8th), innovation (9th), leadership (9th), and work-life balance (10th). </p>\n<p>In its survey report, Vault.com points to West Monroe&rsquo;s strength in work-life balance, noting, &ldquo;While insiders report that long hours are often a fact of life&mdash;as they are elsewhere in the industry&mdash;the firm is notable for its attempts to mitigate this industry norm. The most obvious aspect: a generous vacation policy with days off that employees are actually able to use&mdash;a feat this not always equaled at rival firms.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Vault&rsquo;s research confirms what we know from our own experience, which is that culture is becoming more and more important in the consulting profession,&rdquo; said Dean Fischer, West Monroe Partners&rsquo; Chairman and CEO. &ldquo;Since our founding, we have taken a strong stand with respect to shaping our culture. We work hard, as is typical in this profession, but by putting a &lsquo;people-centric&rsquo; lens on everything we do, we believe we have created a very different and compelling consulting workplace.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In its survey commentary, Vault.com also mentions West Monroe&rsquo;s medium- and long-term growth potential and career development opportunities as strengths. In addition, the written profile highlights the firm&rsquo;s &ldquo;people-first&rdquo; culture and commitment to community service.</p>\n<p>Vault.com annually ranks consultancies using a combination of metrics. In 2013, Vault.com calculated its overall rankings using the following formula: prestige - 30 percent of the total score; satisfaction, firm culture, and compensation - each 15 percent; and work/life balance, overall business outlook, and promotion policies - each 10 percent of the total score.</p>",

The publication surveyed more than 230 businesses in the region, ultimately honoring 85 finalists&mdash;25 each in the small, medium, and large business categories, and 10 in the extra-large business category.</p>\r\n<p>Opened in 2005, the Seattle office today has more than 40 employees and serves more than 20 active clients across the Pacific Northwest, including some of Washington&rsquo;s other &ldquo;Best Workplaces&rdquo;. </p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;West Monroe Partners is built on a foundation of people-focused core values,&rdquo; said Tom Bolger, who has led the Seattle practice since its inception. &ldquo;We believe that focusing on the type of environment and experiences we offer our people translates directly into the quality of service we deliver to our clients. That philosophy is responsible for the growth and success we have enjoyed in the Pacific Northwest.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Like all West Monroe Partners offices, the Seattle practice maintains a highly participatory and collaborative culture marked by an open work environment; frequent employee meetings and gatherings, including an annual retreat at Leavenworth to celebrate Oktoberfest; a strong commitment to serving the local community by hosting firm-sponsored community service events; and regular recognition of its employees. The company has rigorously maintained this culture as it has grown to seven offices across North America and a team of more than 300 consultants&mdash;in part by remaining 100-percent employee owned. Its commitment to a people-first culture enables people at all levels to contribute to the company&rsquo;s direction and share in its results.</p>\r\n<p>This is not the first local or national recognition for West Monroe Partners. Seattle Business Magazine has included the firm on its list of &ldquo;Best Companies to Work For&mdash;Headquartered Outside of Washington&rdquo; for the past two years. Additionally, in 2008, Seattle Business Monthly named West Monroe Partners one of Seattle&rsquo;s &ldquo;Best Places to Work.&rdquo; Recognition like this is not just specific to the Seattle market; West Monroe has institutionalized a people-first oriented culture firm-wide, which has led to national recognition for its workplace by Consulting Magazine and Vault.com as well as multiple local awards in Chicago and Columbus. </p>\r\n<p>The Puget Sound Business Journal asked readers to nominate their own or other companies beginning in March. To be eligible for recognition, companies must be at least four years old with 10 or more full-time employees at an office in Washington. Eligible companies participated by asking full-time Washington-based employees to complete a survey. The publication honored 85 top-scoring companies based on survey results and determined the top three medalist in each category by administering a best practices survey in July.</p>\r\n<p>The publication celebrated all 2012 honorees at an event at Safeco Field on August 9.</p>",

Ranked 20, this is West Monroe Partners&rsquo; first time receiving this honor. <br />\n<br />\nGreat Place to Work cited West Monroe Partners&rsquo; culture and, in particular, its people-first values as a distinguishing factor that contributed to this recognition. In its <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://us.greatrated.com/west-monroe-partners\"><strong>profile of West Monroe Partners</strong></a>, Great Place to Work calls out the firm&rsquo;s recently implemented employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), &ldquo;CXO&rdquo; (chief &ldquo;something&rdquo; officer) program, career equity initiative, and 1+1+1 social responsibility program as unique elements that contribute to a strong and compelling culture and workplace. <br />\n<br />\nA survey of more than 200 West Monroe Partners employees produced ratings of greater than 95 percent in six areas: great challenges (98 percent), great atmosphere (98 percent), great pride (98 percent), great communication (98 percent), great bosses (97 percent), and great rewards (96 percent). <br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;We are extremely honored to receive this recognition from Great Place to Work for the first time,&rdquo; said Dean Fischer, West Monroe Partners&rsquo; CEO and co-founder. &ldquo;We founded this firm with the intent to create a distinctive culture, and it is particularly rewarding to see how this impacts our people today&mdash;after 11 years and significant growth and expansion. What struck me the most was a comment from one of our employees who has worked for a number of consulting companies and describes our firm as &lsquo;nothing like any of them.&rsquo;&rdquo; <br />\n<br />\nCompeting against hundreds of companies across the country, West Monroe Partners participated in a rigorous selection process, which included an employee survey and an in-depth questionnaire about benefits programs and company practices. Great Place to Work evaluates each application using its unique methodology based on five dimensions: credibility, respect, fairness, pride, and camaraderie. In compiling the list, Great Place to Work&reg; has found that employees believe they work for great organizations when they consistently trust the people the work for, have pride in what they do, and enjoy the people they work with. <br />\n<br />\nDivided into two categories, Small (50-250 employees) and Medium (251-999 employees), the list has recognized companies with exceptional workplace cultures for the past ten years. <br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;The companies appearing on our Best Small &amp; Medium Workplaces list help us achieve our mission by presenting others with an example to emulate. These companies demonstrate that being an excellent employer leads to business success,&rdquo; said Robert Levering, CEO and Co-founder of Great Place to Work. &ldquo;While these companies may be relatively small in headcount, many of them provide services to some of the country&rsquo;s largest and most notable organizations, suggesting that success has not so much to do with size as with the quality of service and experience a company provides. A great workplace, full of great employees, is better equipped to achieve that success.&rdquo; <br />\n<br />\nOrganizations named on the list see many benefits that include better financial performance, less employee turnover, higher levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty, more innovative and creative thinking, higher productivity and enhanced public perception. <br />\n<br />\nMore information about Great Place to Work is available at <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.greatplacetowork.com\">www.greatplacetowork.com</a>. <br />\n<br />\n</p>\n<p><strong>About Great Place to Work</strong> <br />\nGreat Place to Work<sup>&reg;</sup> is a global consulting and&nbsp;<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.greatplacetowork.com/our-services/change-your-organization\">management training firm</a> specializing in workplace excellence and development of <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.greatplacetowork.com/our-approach/what-is-a-great-workplace\">high-trust organizational cultures</a>.

With a five-year growth rate of 148 percent, West Monroe ranked 36 on the list of 50 companies.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nSince opening its doors eleven years ago, West Monroe has grown revenue to more than $65.4 million and headcount to over 350 consultants. At the end of 2012 West Monroe opened its eighth office in Minneapolis.<br />\n<br />\nSeveral contributing factors had an impact on West Monroe&rsquo;s success over the last year. In 2012 West Monroe saw incremental growth as clients became increasingly active in the revitalized M&amp;A market. By adding a dedicated insurance practice leader and supporting talent, the firm&rsquo;s insurance practice revenue increased significantly from 2011 to 2012. Additionally, the energy sector experienced high growth with rising interest in renewable energy projects. West Monroe continues to rely on our E&amp;U expertise to support these efforts, such as: &nbsp;working with the City of Chicago on a program to help make the Chicago land area a leading U.S. market for residential and commercial rooftop solar. &nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Our success can be attributed to the discipline and focus on quality over quantity &ndash; both with our people and our clients.&rdquo; said Dean Fischer, the company&rsquo;s CEO and one of its founders. &ldquo;We know&mdash;and have seen time and time again&mdash;that when you have happy people, this translates to better client service and better quality work. In fact, our motto is &rsquo;to do the work we love with the people we trust&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThis is West Monroe Partners&rsquo; fifth time on the Crain&rsquo;s Fast Fifty list over the past six years. Additionally, it has been listed as a top company to work for nationally by Consulting Magazine and Vault Inc.; in Chicago by Crain&rsquo;s, the Chicago Tribune and the National Association of Business Resources; in Seattle by Seattle Business Monthly and Puget Sound Business Journal; and in Columbus by Columbus Business First.<br />\n<br />\nTo qualify for the Fast Fifty list, Crain&rsquo;s evaluated companies with an inception date on or before December 31, 2007; with headquarters in the six-county area (Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will) as of December 31, 2011; and with 2012 revenue of at least $20 million. The publication required financial statements or tax returns and enlisted an outside accounting firm to assist with verifying the financial information.</p>",

The winners, hailing from 18 cities across the state of Washington, were chosen based on extensive surveys completed by nearly 10,000 employees. &nbsp;Employees&rsquo; detailed responses were used to determine each company&rsquo;s score in 10 categories, including such vital areas as communication, executive leadership, corporate culture and workplace environment. A panel of judges selected the top winners in each category.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Receiving this recognition as a top employer four years in a row is a remarkable accomplishment, and we are honored to be in such elite company,&rdquo; said Tom Bolger, managing director and founder of the Seattle office. &ldquo;It can be challenging to distinguish one consulting firm from others, but we are successfully doing that at West Monroe Partners.

For judging purposes, nominated companies were separated into five classifications: small firms (30 or fewer employees), midsize (31 to 100 employees), large (more than 100 employees), nonprofits and firms headquartered outside Washington.</p>",

From day one, we strive to put our people in complex business situations and encourage them to challenge the status quo. By inspiring our people with the right career opportunities and rewarding them for exceptional work, we are able to deliver both outstanding client work and tremendous career and professional development opportunities.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Since West Monroe Partners was founded 10 years ago, business and industry publications&mdash;from Consulting Magazine and Vault.com to the Chicago Tribune and Seattle Business Magazine&mdash;have recognized the firm numerous times for its growth, client service, culture and career opportunities. </p>",

					"content": "<p>CHICAGO &ndash; West Monroe Partners, a national business and technology consultancy, today announced promotions of three executives to C-level roles: Tom Bolger to chief strategy officer, Doug Armstrong to chief operating officer, and Casey Foss to chief marketing officer. The promotions were effective on January 1.&ldquo;These promotions reflect the exemplary contributions that Tom Bolger, Doug Armstrong, and Casey Foss have made to West Monroe&rsquo;s consistent, profitable growth,&rdquo; said <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=4D415E5E7A104990BE2F9291F0C4F49A&amp;_z=z\">Kevin McCarty</a>, West Monroe&rsquo;s president and CEO.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h3>&ldquo;Simply put, West Monroe would not be where it is or what it is today without their dedication, passion, and expertise. By stepping into elevated roles, they are helping us ensure we have the leadership bandwidth and executive capabilities necessary to maintain high client satisfaction and deliver against atypical growth for our industry.&rdquo;</h3>\n<div>\n<p>The investment in three particular areas&mdash;strategic growth, operations, and marketing&mdash;reflects unanimous endorsement from West Monroe&rsquo;s board to continue to prioritize organizational speed and building scale. The firm&rsquo;s projected growth requires purposeful planning and synergies among all three functions, underpinning the need for C-level leadership and investment in the three areas.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Bolger, age 46, joined West Monroe in 2005 and founded the firm&rsquo;s Seattle office. Over the past 13 years, he has overseen the firm&rsquo;s growth and presence on the West Coast, which now includes offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco, as well as Seattle. He also has created and led the Strategic Growth team, which orchestrates rapid growth through organic and acquisitive approaches, as well as innovation. He is a member of the Investment Committee of West Monroe Capital, a co-investment business he helped design and launch in 2018. As chief strategy officer (CSO), Bolger will focus exclusively on designing and implementing firmwide strategy, increasing corporate development efforts, and doubling investment in the firm&rsquo;s innovation and third-party partnership.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Armstrong, age 56, joined West Monroe in 2004 and played key early roles in developing the firm&rsquo;s initial Marketing &amp; Business Development functions and what is now the Customer Experience (CX) practice. He has led the Chicago office since 2014, a period that has seen the office more than double in size and earn recognition as one of the city&rsquo;s top workplaces. As chief operating officer (COO), he will expand his line operating leadership to include oversight for all east and west coast West Monroe offices, while continuing to serve as leader for the Chicago office and Central Region, which includes locations in Minneapolis and Dallas. His new role includes promoting collaboration and operating consistency across all nine of the firm&rsquo;s offices to facilitate growth.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=138F7D55B5A14438A584D42C3EF948A4&amp;_z=z\">Foss</a>, age 37, joined West Monroe in 2008 and assumed leadership for the marketing function in 2011. She facilitated development of the firm&rsquo;s brand identity, which reflects the organization&rsquo;s &ldquo;uncommon blend&rdquo; of business consulting acumen and deep technology expertise. She also has built a multi-faceted marketing team that executes programs across practices and offices, established client-facing programs that set West Monroe apart as a trusted advisor, and drives several of the firm&rsquo;s strategic initiatives including issues-based consulting. As chief marketing officer (CMO), Foss will continue to lead marketing and brand recognition efforts, but will increase her focus on driving value through external market-facing activity to elevate West Monroe&rsquo;s profile in the marketplace. Her role will also include leading teams to create solutions and capabilities that address key client issues such as digital transformation and workforce productivity. She also will focus on improving capabilities for using market intelligence and insights to define future strategy.</p>\n<p>West Monroe has grown from a 2002 startup to a firm of more than 1,100 employees with nine offices across the United States. In 2017, it announced plans to <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=7BE5205F52704C85A66167AD4DBE70B4&amp;_z=z\">double its workforce</a> over five years and in 2018, the firm made great strides towards this goal hiring 289 employees.

This ranking considered 74,000 surveys from employees at hundreds of businesses in all sectors of the economy. West Monroe earned a spot on this list based on co-workers&rsquo; assessment of the camaraderie, leadership, fairness, rewards, and career opportunities enjoyed by all in their workplace. |</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an honor to be recognized as a best firm yet again,&rdquo; said Kevin McCarty, President and CEO of West Monroe. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t set out to be an award-winning company when we opened our doors 15 years ago, but we did seek to be a people-first organization. This vision guides everything we do, from extending our 100-percent employee ownership model to all of our people, to making it our mission to build the next generation of leaders.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nOutstanding small and mid-sized employers &ndash; as identified by their employees &ndash; are substantially more likely to report work experiences linked to retention, innovation and good customer service, according to research by Great Place to Work&reg;.

All of these enhance business performance and create a positive environment for doing business,&rdquo; said Michael Bush, CEO of Great Place to Work&reg;.<br />\n<br />\nThe Best Small and Medium Workplaces is one of a series of rankings by Great Place to Work and Fortune based upon employee survey feedback from Great Place to Work&ndash;Certified&trade; organizations. West Monroe also ranked as a best workplace for Giving Back and Millennials, Consulting and Professional Services and Best Small and Medium Workplaces in Chicago by Great Place to Work and Fortune.</p>\n<h2>\nAbout the Best Small &amp; Medium Workplaces</h2>\n<p>\nThe ranking was based on anonymous feedback from more than 74,000 employees working at Great Place to Work-Certified organizations. Employees completed a Trust Index&trade; survey with more than 50 questions assessing pride, camaraderie, executive effectiveness, innovation, benefits, professional development and other elements of a great workplace. Scores also considered organizations&rsquo; performance relative to their size and industry, as well as their ability to provide a great workplace for all employees, regardless of who they are or what they do. Survey results from eligible companies had a 6 percent margin of error, at most, with a 95 percent confidence level. Organizations with 10 to 99 employees were considered for the small workplaces list and those with 100-999 employees were considered for the medium list.</p>\n<h2>\nAbout Great Place to Work</h2>\n<p>\nGreat Place to Work is the global authority on high-trust, high-performance workplace cultures.

CommunityHealth is the largest volunteer-based free medical facility in the United States.</p>\n<p>\nSince 2013, West Monroe has provided business and technology expertise to support CommunityHealth in two ways. It has performed several pro bono projects that helped CommunityHealth operate more efficiently and effectively; for example, an IT/process assessment of point-of-care services and implementation of new practice management and electronic medical records solutions. The firm also has donated (and continues to donate) 24/7 IT help-desk and user-support services that help CommunityHealth maintain a reliable infrastructure.

Key highlights include:</p>\n<div>\n<h2>\nHR Leaders Want Soft Skills (But They Don&rsquo;t Cultivate Them)&nbsp;</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p>98 percent of HR leaders say soft skills are important in landing a technology position - so important that 67 percent say they have withheld a job offer from an otherwise qualified technical candidate solely because they lacked soft skills.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>They ranked verbal communication and collaboration the most important soft skills. Once a hired, however, most companies don&rsquo;t invest in developing their technology professionals&rsquo; soft skills further. In fact, around one-quarter of companies provide soft skills training to line-of-business employees, but not to IT.</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Technology Professionals Aren&rsquo;t Seen as Leaders</h2>\n<div>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p>HR leaders consider leadership to be the least important soft skill for prospective technology hires.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>Technology employees often don&rsquo;t ascend the career ladder, with 39 percent of companies lacking a technology background in the c-suite. This absence affects collaboration between business and tech employees.</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Lacking Soft Skills Hurts An Organization&rsquo;s Ability to Innovate&nbsp;</h2>\n</div>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p>43 percent of full-time employees say soft-skills-related challenges with IT have negatively impacted their work, which is problematic considering that innovative projects increasingly require employees to work alongside each other.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>Collaboration-based issues have delayed or prolonged a project for 71 percent of respondents. A third of employees have missed a deadline altogether because of communication issues.</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Technologists and full-time employees are collaborating more than ever, and it&rsquo;s evident this will continue in the coming years,&rdquo; said Greg Layok, senior director of West Monroe&rsquo;s technology practice. &ldquo;However, communication barriers can still silo these groups and stifle productivity. Businesses must take a two-pronged approach to training - one that not only develops technologists&rsquo; soft skills to effectively collaborate with the line of business, but also teaches business leaders a level of fluency to understand the technology side.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\nWest Monroe, as a company, was built on the mission of developing talent with an uncommon blend of business acumen and deep technology expertise.

The transaction completed on December 31, 2012, transferring 100-percent of ownership to the ESOP trust. All U.S. employees, currently numbering more than 325 people, will participate as beneficial owners of the firm. <br />\n<br />\nSince its inception, West Monroe Partners has operated on the principle of remaining employee owned and people focused&mdash;advocating that this environment produces a team of professionals personally invested in service quality and motivated to act in the best interests of each other, the firm, and its clients. <br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Restructuring as an ESOP is an exciting development for both our clients and people,&rdquo; said Dean Fischer, West Monroe Partners&rsquo; CEO and co-founder. &ldquo;This takes our concept of employee-ownership to an even higher level by making everyone part of a team whose actions and decisions impact our client service and, in turn, drive our company&rsquo;s performance and value. It also better positions our company to take advantage of emerging growth opportunities that enhance our ability today to assist clients in a dynamic marketplace.&rdquo; <br />\n<br />\nThe privately held ESOP also enables West Monroe Partners employees to participate in the continued growth and success of the company through the vested value of stock allocated to their accounts, and it provides an attractive financial benefit as they build their careers with West Monroe Partners. <br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a clich&eacute;, but in our profession it&rsquo;s absolutely true: People are our product. Attracting and retaining the best people is essential to our success,&rdquo; Fischer added. &ldquo;Establishing the ESOP formalizes and strengthens the concept of employee ownership and reinforces an important aspect of our core values. It is one of a number of steps we have undertaken recently to refocus on our people and their career opportunities at West Monroe Partners and to build a solid and attractive workplace for future generations of employees.&rdquo; <br />\n<br />\nWest Monroe Partners, which celebrated its tenth anniversary in business during 2012, has demonstrated a strong track record for year-over-year growth. In addition, it has received national recognition as a leading employer from Vault.com and Consulting Magazine, as well as from major business publications in three of its primary markets: Chicago, Seattle, and Columbus. </p>",

					"content": "<p>CHICAGO &ndash; Digitally mature businesses have higher revenue growth and net profits&mdash;regardless of a company&rsquo;s industry. In particular, four digital characteristics &ndash; a clear vision and dedicated leadership, engaged employees who are intrinsically motivated, an ability to leverage data for insights, and digital interactions that are convenient and effortless &ndash; showed a high correlation with stellar financial performance, defined in the survey as annual growth rates above 10 percent.These are among the key findings in a new report, &ldquo;<a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=E5091A4987794D01B2F69E04FEF8F9C5&amp;_z=z\">Digital Leaders: Learn from Digitally Mature Companies to Grow Revenue and Profits</a>,&rdquo; released today by West Monroe Partners, a business and technology consultancy that aids organizations through their digital transformation journeys.\n</p>\n<p>&ldquo;To keep up with the most digitally mature organizations, companies need to start thinking of digital as more than a buzzword that only applies to certain segments of their organizations or as the latest technology update,&rdquo; said Kyle Hutchins, senior director and leader of the firm&rsquo;s Digital team. &ldquo;The challenge is often knowing the right digital elements to focus on and if efforts will actually drive revenue. With this research, we are able to conduct conversations with organizations about what specifically they can do to see direct impact on their revenue and profits.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>West Monroe conducted the online survey with 407 executives based in the United States to understand perspectives on digital maturity and the impact of employing digital initiatives across four industries: healthcare, financial services, energy and utilities, and manufacturing (specifically consumer and industrial products). Respondents were divided among C-level executives and senior managers with decision-making influence for digital investment. Survey respondents self-assessed their organizations on 16 components of digital maturity. Supplementary qualitative interviews were conducted with 10 senior executives in support of the quantitative research.</p>\n<p>The survey found digital maturity levels are fairly evenly divided across the spectrum from &ldquo;not digitally mature&rdquo; to &ldquo;very digitally mature,&rdquo; with the largest percentage of companies &ndash; 21.5 percent &ndash; characterizing themselves as average. Some industries are farther along in the digital journey: Almost half (47 percent) of financial services organizations consider themselves to be digitally mature or very mature, as opposed to only 31 percent of healthcare organizations.</p>\n<p>Across all industries, half of companies are investing to digitize their operating model. The most digitally mature companies spend 35 percent of overall budget on digital initiatives.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When thinking about investment, consider that three of the four elements that most correlated with financial performance explicitly cite customers,&rdquo; said Greg Layok, managing director and leader of West Monroe&rsquo;s Technology practice. &ldquo;Time and time again, we see a customer-focused mindset ensure that digital transformation isn&rsquo;t simply about &lsquo;technology for technology&rsquo;s sake.&rsquo; Instead, it makes digital tangible, actionable, and most importantly, profitable.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Other key findings of the report, which illustrates practical, real-world examples of digital in action, include:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <p>Most companies have work to do to establish a clear digital vision. Only 24 percent of respondents strongly agreed that their &ldquo;organization&rsquo;s digital vision is clear and comprehensive, widely understood, and used to guide strategic decisions.&rdquo;</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <p>Strong leadership has a particularly high correlation with financial performance. More than one-third &ndash; 36 percent &ndash; of organizations with annual growth rates above 10 percent strongly agree that they have a definitive leader charged with executing on digital efforts. (That rises to 51 percent for those with annual growth rates above 40 percent.)</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>A full copy of the report is available <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=E5091A4987794D01B2F69E04FEF8F9C5&amp;_z=z\">here.</a></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About West Monroe Partners</span></strong><br />\nWest Monroe is a national business and technology consulting firm that partners with dynamic organizations to reimagine, build, and operate their businesses at peak performance.

					"content": "<p>West Monroe Partners<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">&rsquo;</span>, a full-service North American business and technology consultancy, latest study, <a href=\"http://www.westmonroe.com/Insights/White-Papers/future-healthcare-customer-experience\"><em>No More Waiting Room: The Future of Healthcare Customer Experience</em></a>, reveals how consumers and healthcare insurance executives look at how technology is changing the healthcare customer experience. Eighty percent of consumers who have communicated real-time with their healthcare provider via a mobile app prefer this method over a traditional office visit, according to new research.</p>\n<p>The study highlights how consumer preferences are shifting away from traditional office visits, toward more digital, mobile interactions. These changing habits are especially apparent among younger, tech-native consumers who view their healthcare experience as more than an annual checkup, but rather an ongoing, digitally connected relationship with their providers. However, healthcare providers and insurers are not prepared to meet these evolving needs.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Healthcare providers realize the impact of digital communication channels and are beginning to adapt,&rdquo; said Will Hinde, senior director at West Monroe Partners and leader of the firm&rsquo;s Healthcare practice. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re starting to see more providers incorporate the digital experience with their office visit, by shifting to more online scheduling of appointments, paperless office interactions, following up via email, portals, and mobile apps, and taking steps towards greater cost and quality transparency.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Consumers are overwhelmingly gravitating toward digital channels like online portals and mobile apps to connect with their healthcare providers when offered. According to the study, 86 percent of consumers who have access to online portals use them for some or all of their communication with their healthcare provider, while 91 percent use mobile apps when they are available. In addition, nearly one-third (31%) of consumers have used a mobile application to communicate with their healthcare provider in real time about a specific condition.</p>\n<p>While consumers&rsquo; expectations of the healthcare experience are rapidly changing, healthcare executives don&rsquo;t feel prepared to meet their needs. According to the study, 85 percent of healthcare insurance executives aren&rsquo;t confident they have the right technology in place to evolve the customer experience to meet consumer expectations and 54 percent aren&rsquo;t confident they have the processes needed to evolve that experience. </p>\n<p>Healthcare insurance executives are also challenged by consumers&rsquo; reluctance to share personal data with them. Given the volume, scale and visibility of healthcare-based cyberattacks over the past few years, less than half of consumers (48%) completely trust their provider with their personal information. In many instances, consumers are willing to overcome their privacy concerns if rewarded with better rates and a higher quality of service. However, only eight percent of healthcare insurers offer discounted rates in exchange for participation, while none offer direct discounts on products or services.</p>\n<p><a name=\"_gjdgxs\"></a>\"Health insurers should take cues from the retail and banking industries,&rdquo; said Kyle Hutchins, senior director of Customer Experience at West Monroe Partners. &ldquo;From booking an appointment to receiving an explanation of benefits, healthcare organizations wanting to keep up with today&rsquo;s pace of change must have an agile operating model. They also need to start building cross-functional teams and redefining HR hiring practices.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>You can access West Monroe Partner&rsquo;s full study, <em>No More Waiting Room: The Future of Healthcare Customer Experience</em>, <a href=\"http://www.westmonroe.com/Insights/White-Papers/future-healthcare-customer-experience\">here</a>.</p>",

					"content": "<p>CHICAGO- Driven largely by state policy, financial incentives, and customer demand, the influx of solar, smart thermostats, electric vehicles (EVs) and other distributed energy resources (DERs) is fundamentally reshaping the electric utility industry. New research confirms rapid deployment: 92 percent of electric utilities say they have DERs on their system, up from 80 percent three years ago.</p>\n<p>Additionally, more than 40 percent of utilities see DERs as an opportunity, up from 31 percent previously. Yet, this said, 80 percent of customers report that their utility has not yet approached them with any alternative energy options, suggesting many utilities have not yet fully seized the opportunity or regulators have not given them direction or incentives to do so.</p>\n<p>These are among the key findings in a new report, &ldquo;<a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=5FFEC53BFE7A43C9B637018A5F1B16DD&amp;_z=z\">Planning for a Distributed Energy Future</a>,&rdquo; released today by West Monroe Partners, a national business and technology consultancy. The research is a follow-up to West Monroe&rsquo;s 2016 study, &ldquo;Keeping the Lights On,&rdquo; which revealed that while utilities and regulators understood that customer interest in DERs was significant and rising, the actual adoption was still limited.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This year&rsquo;s survey confirms that utilities are taking actions necessary to accommodate increasing penetrations of DERs resources on the grid, yet those actions are not at the rate required to keep ahead of customers&rsquo; demand and regulators&rsquo; expectations,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=293994505D8745CFAC1DDD20363A21EE&amp;_z=z\">Paul DeCotis</a>, senior director in West Monroe&rsquo;s Energy &amp; Utilities practice and lead author of the study.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>&ldquo;The survey results suggest that no matter what DER penetration is today, the next few years will be extremely important. The fact that more utilities are making foundational investments to gain better visibility and insight into their impact on grid operations is encouraging. The ability to generate new sources of revenue from business and data analytics is also very promising.&rdquo;</h3>\n<p>West Monroe conducted the survey in partnership with Greentech Media, with responses from more than 1,700 utility customers, 140 utility executives and managers, and more than two dozen regulators in major markets across North America. The research goal was to revisit customer attitudes toward DER adoption, the ongoing impacts DERs are having on utility operations in the United States, and what both utilities and regulatory bodies are doing (or plan to do) to accommodate increasing customer demands for DERs from strategy through process and technology needs and system integration.</p>\n<p>More than 90 percent of utilities said DERs were having some impact on their operations or revenue, yet nearly 60 percent said they had no specific management services available for DERs. This highlights the mismatch between the proliferation of DERs connecting to the grid and the near-term planning necessary to accommodate them in novel ways.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Failure to be proactive exposes utilities to risk,&rdquo; said DeCotis. &ldquo;By not developing systems and processes needed to accommodate growing demand for distributed energy resources, utilities take the risk that large and small customers may bypass the utility grid in favor of self-generation with or without utility back-up service. Customers bypassing the utility altogether is a threat from new large loads interested in contracting with third parties to provide electric service directly onsite.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Other key findings of the report include:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>15 percent of customers said they have renewable energy resources powering their homes. This represents a five-fold increase from the three percent who did three years ago. A majority of customers, 60 percent, said solar is the renewable energy supplying power to their homes.</li>\n    <li>While residential customers are still seen as driving most of the demand, 66 percent of utilities said third parties (other than customers) were adding DERs, up from 32 percent in the previous survey. Nearly 30 percent of utilities said aggregated communities are adding DERs to their system today, up from 12 percent three years ago. Depending on the regulatory construct, these entities can compete with the utility.</li>\n    <li>40 percent of regulators are now looking at performance-based ratemaking, up from 25 percent three years ago.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A full copy of the report is available&nbsp;<a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=5FFEC53BFE7A43C9B637018A5F1B16DD&amp;_z=z\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About West Monroe Partners</span></strong><br />\nWest Monroe is a national business and technology consulting firm that partners with dynamic organizations to reimagine, build, and operate their businesses at peak performance.

					"content": "<p>CHICAGO &ndash; More than a decade after the financial crisis, mid-market banks still have a long way to go to reach optimal efficiency &ndash; despite holding it as a top priority today. Half of mid-market banks report that boosting productivity is the No. 1 strategic priority, ahead of driving new customer growth, expanding digital presence, and improving security. Yet, while nearly 80 percent of bank executives perceive they have been extremely or very successful in improving efficiency and/or productivity in the past year, only 34 percent report having an efficiency ratio at or below 50 percent.</p>\n<p>These are among the key findings in a new report, &ldquo;<a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=66F38D48DC6B4270B006D55D12DABAA5&amp;_z=z\">Driving Down the Bank Efficiency Ratio: Despite Digital Adoption, Vast Improvements Remain,</a>&rdquo; released today by West Monroe Partners, a business and technology consultancy.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The efficiency ratio is the single most important metric for banks seeing to understand the productivity of their organizations and remains the key indicator of progress in the quest to become more efficient,&rdquo; said <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=2C30918EBAB64ECDB806568D832AEBB8&amp;_z=z\">Neil Hartman</a>, senior director in West Monroe&rsquo;s <a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=D693FCF3AF424FA6A08FDBF6E111C7FC&amp;_z=z\">Financial Services practice</a>.</p>\n<h2>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing mid-market banks invest in the right technologies to drive more efficiency, but the progress is too slow&mdash;and it could be sped up if executives turned their attention to the how the tech is implemented.&rdquo;</h2>\n<p>In Q2 2019, West Monroe surveyed more than 150 executives across U.S.-based mid-market banks &ndash; entities with $1 billion to $250 billion in managed assets &ndash; to gauge whether they are fully leveraging these opportunities to drive up productivity in their organizations.</p>\n<p>Nearly all &ndash; 98 percent &ndash; of bank executives said they are currently implementing strategies to improve efficiency. Technology is the most common strategy employed, with 61 percent of banks indicating they are leveraging automation tools. Many, however, reported lackluster results with new technology. While 91 percent said technology acceptance is high, only 43 percent of banks are seeing results from those investments.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;New technologies make possible what was unthinkable a decade ago. They are causing profound changes in workforce development, organizational structure, management, executive priorities, and shareholder expectations,&rdquo; said Jerin May, director in the Technology practice&nbsp;and West Coast Security &amp; Infrastructure services leader. &ldquo;The industry is making the right investments to make significant gains in productivity, but banks should first focus on optimizing their technology investments. When new technology is not fully aligned with an organization&rsquo;s goals, strategy, people, and even available skillsets, results will always lag.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Other key findings of the report include:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>While automation is the most commonly implemented strategy, many banks also report implementing performance management tools (60 percent), data-driven strategies (48 percent), and training programs (45 percent) as a means of improving productivity and efficiency.</li>\n    <li>Banks&rsquo; moves to introduce new technology often lack a broader strategy. Only 34 percent of executives surveyed said that when they implement a new technology to improve efficiency, they always redesign the business process first.</li>\n    <li>Banks must change how employees work alongside new technology. In the survey, 73 percent said they are using time freed-up by automation to focus on strategic initiatives, while 67 percent said they use that time to complete other tactical activities. Only 38 percent are using that time for relationship management and selling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A full copy of the report is available here.</p>\n<p><strong>About West Monroe Partners</strong></p>\n<p>West Monroe is a national business and technology consulting firm that partners with dynamic organizations to reimagine, build, and operate their businesses at peak performance.

					"content": "<p>West Monroe Partners, a North American management and technology consulting firm, today announced that Will McNamara, PMP, has recently joined the firm&rsquo;s Chicago office as a Senior Manager in the Energy &amp; Utilities practice. </p>\n<p>Mr. McNamara is a regulatory and legislative affairs expert with over 15 years of energy industry policy-making, project management, expert testimony, and stakeholder-relations experience. Mr. McNamara has unique expertise in developing Smart Grid / AMI policy and managing business plans and regulatory filings that have enabled utility clients to achieve regulatory and community support for their project initiatives.</p>\n<p sizset=\"64\" sizcache=\"2\">Mr. McNamara comes to West Monroe from KEMA, Inc., where he served as a Senior Principal Consultant. In that role Mr. McNamara assisted utility clients such as Duke Energy, Consolidated Edison, Los Angeles District Water &amp; Power, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, the Southern California Public Power Authority, and the Snohomish Public Utility District in managing their diverse AMI / Smart Grid deployments. Prior to KEMA, Mr. McNamara served as Regulatory and Legislative Policy Manager for Sempra Energy, where he developed the corporate policy response to energy-related matters before the California Public Utilities Commission, the California Legislature and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In addition to being a certified Project Management Professional (PMP), Mr. McNamara is also a published author in the energy sector, having written an analytical account of the California energy crisis.</p>\n<p>West Monroe Partner&rsquo;s new Regulatory Support &amp; Key Stakeholder Relations service offering expands the firm&rsquo;s existing suite of management and technology services for utility clients. West Monroe has been active in the regulatory space through the preparation of AMI / Smart Grid business cases for utility clients and their key stakeholders, including public utility commissions, utility advisory boards, and city councils. The maturing of the AMI / Smart Grid industry is driving needs within utilities for regulatory and key stakeholder services, including operational &amp; performance benchmarking analysis; regulatory compliance assistance; expert testimony in regulatory proceedings; mobilizing community and key stakeholder support for AMI / Smart Grid utility projects; internal management alignment within client organizations; and expanded services associated with federal and state grant opportunities for utilities, an area in which West Monroe is already well established.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Will McNamara adds a significant regulatory, community-relations, and key stakeholder management capability to West Monroe&rsquo;s Energy &amp; Utilities practice, as well as substantial hands-on experience guiding utility clients through the many regulatory and public-relations challenges that are becoming such a prominent consideration for Smart Grid deployments,&rdquo; said Tom Hulsebosch, managing director of West Monroe Partner&rsquo;s E&amp;U practice. &ldquo;We believe that our Regulatory and Key Stakeholder service offering will be valuable to public power, cooperative, and investor owned utilities alike. We are seeing a significantly higher engagement from all of the utility stakeholders, which if not managed properly can negatively impact a utility&rsquo;s AMI/Smart Grid program.&rdquo;</p>\n<p sizset=\"65\" sizcache=\"2\">&ldquo;I am thrilled to join West Monroe&rsquo;s already-thriving E&amp;U practice and contribute to the firm&rsquo;s very compelling capabilities,&rdquo; said McNamara. &ldquo;My current perspective is what I refer to as the &lsquo;second wave&rsquo; of utility AMI/ Smart Grid deployment, utilities across the U.S. facing increased regulatory and public challenges. This is a particular concern among smaller and mid-sized utilities that are still formulating their initial deployment strategies. One benefit we have is to learn from the experiences of the utilities that are further down the deployment path. I believe performance benchmarking, as one example, will become a very important and strategic tool in the regulatory environment going forward.&rdquo;</p>\n<p sizset=\"65\" sizcache=\"2\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.westmonroe.com/Industries/Energy-and-Utilities\">Read more about West Monroe Partner&rsquo;s work within the utility industry</a></strong>.

					"content": "<p style=\"margin-bottom: 5.25pt; vertical-align: baseline;\">May 24, 2017 &mdash; West Monroe Partners, a business and technology consulting firm, today announced as a prestigious honoree of the 2017 Workforce 100 presented by Workforce magazine, a Human Capital Media publication. Now in its fourth year, Workforce 100 designates companies as the best in HR management through statistical analysis conducted by Human Capital Media Advisory Group. West Monroe ranked No. 31 in its first time on the list.<br />\n<br />\nThe Workforce 100 chart indicates the rank order and scores of the 100 companies that performed best in seven core areas: workplace culture; employee benefits; diversity and inclusion; employee development/ talent management; HR innovation/management; leadership development; recruiting and talent acquisition. The working assumption is that high performance in these categories would provide a reasonable proxy for overall HR excellence.<br />\n<br />\nWest Monroe&rsquo;s Chief People Officer Susan M. Stelter is pictured on the cover of the magazine and featured in the cover story about first-time companies on the list. In the article, she highlighted West Monroe&rsquo;s people-first culture. &ldquo;It is an honor to be ranked No. 31 out of the top 100 companies for best-in-class people practices,&rdquo; Stelter said. &ldquo;This is a testament to the passion and engagement of our 850-plus employee owners who make the firm a great place to work every day.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nWest Monroe&rsquo;s unique people practices include a 1+1+1 program where the firm donates 1% of its time, 1% of its talent, and 1% of its treasure to the greater good. Employees earn paid time off for each hour they volunteer through this program. The firm also supports employees&rsquo; philanthropic and humanitarian interests with an extended three- to six-month compensated leave through the <a href=\"https://www.acceptthechallenge.com/Values-and-Rewards/Doing-Good\">Fischer Fellowship Program</a>.<br />\n<br />\nTo find out which companies are the best for HR management, Workforce editors, along with researchers from the Human Capital Media Advisory Group, the magazine&rsquo;s research arm, created a statistical formula to sift through publicly available information to separate the best from the rest. The result of that analysis is the Workforce 100 list.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;re pleased this awards program continues to grow in popularity, but also in its ability to report organizations&rsquo; performance with greater accuracy,&rdquo; said Rick Bell, Workforce magazine&rsquo;s editorial director. &ldquo;Our rankings are compiled with tangible data backed by extensive research, and it continues to prove valuable in setting industry benchmarks.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nWorkforce 100 honorees were announced on April 21, 2017 and West Monroe is profiled in the May/June issue of Workforce magazine.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Media Contact:</strong><br />\nChristina Galoozis<br />\ncgaloozis@westmonroe.com<br />\n312.447.6623</p>\n<h2 style=\"margin-bottom: 5.25pt; vertical-align: baseline;\">About West Monroe</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 5.25pt; vertical-align: baseline;\">West Monroe is a progressive business and technology consulting firm that partners with dynamic organizations to reimagine, build, and operate their businesses at peak performance.
