The study found that more than half of North American supply chain executives currently consider developing a sustainable supply chain as a strategic priority.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe study also found that of companies that plan to implement sustainability initiatives, improved competitive advantage and brand image are the key motivators. According to West Monroe\u0026rsquo;s study, 36 percent of companies have plans to incorporate sustainability into their operations and 22 percent of that group plan to do so in the next one to three years.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nLast year, West Monroe conducted a sustainability survey amongst North American consumers and found that more than half of consumers are willing to pay at least 5 percent higher prices for products ordered online if they\u0026rsquo;re delivered sustainably, and 76 percent would wait at least one extra day for climate-friendly transport. European consumers shared a similar willingness to wait longer and slightly more tolerance for higher prices, according to the equivalent survey conducted by BearingPoint. Given these findings, it\u0026rsquo;s surprising that more companies aren\u0026rsquo;t making sustainability a strategic priority.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s telling that more companies aren\u0026rsquo;t implementing sustainable business practices in their operations given the demands of customers,\u0026rdquo; said Yves Leclerc, managing director at West Monroe. \u0026ldquo;Most supply chain teams are struggling to manage the complexities of globalization, the war for talent and increasing demands so allocating budget and resources towards sustainability doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem feasible unless companies can put together a business case for the return on the investment.\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nWest Monroe, Loyola University Chicago and BearingPoint sought to better understand how North American companies are incorporating sustainable business practices into their operations. To further the analysis, the North American survey\u0026rsquo;s results were compared against a survey conducted by West Monroe\u0026rsquo;s global alliance partner, BearingPoint. In Europe, 59 percent of companies surveyed stated that developing a sustainable supply chain is already a strategic priority. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nSimilar to North American respondents, European supply chain executives also cite brand image improvement as the most important motivator. Innovation was far less important in European respondents than in North American respondents (36 percent versus 47 percent). Dissimilar to North American respondents, European supply chain executives placed the highest importance on the economic impacts of sustainability whereas North American executives prioritized environmental impact.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nWest Monroe joined the Loyola Supply and Value Chain Center, a group of supply chain professionals working to improve global supply chain management and sustainability, in June of 2014. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nA copy of the full survey results can be found \u003ca href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=55632E52B6DC483D84BCE603B3758A42\u0026amp;_z=z\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eAbout West Monroe\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nWest Monroe is a progressive business and technology consulting firm that partners with dynamic organizations to reimagine, build, and operate their businesses at peak performance.

And, cybersecurity is the top concern on everyone\u0026rsquo;s minds \u0026ndash; both around the risk associated with integrated systems and insufficient expertise within the utility work force. These are among the key findings from new research released today at DistribuTECH by West Monroe Partners, a national business and technology consultancy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nIndustry survey results highlight challenges utilities face as they modernize. The findings provide valuable insight into how utilities are managing the integration of IT and OT, and where they should focus to advance their strategies. More than 140 U.S. utility professionals, representing a range of utility types, services, and sizes, completed the survey in late 2017.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe full research paper, \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.westmonroe.com/Insights/White-Papers/Managing-Grid-Modernization\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;Managing Grid Modernization: Integrating IT and Operations at U.S. Utilities,\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e is being shared at DistribuTECH, the leading annual electric power transmission and distribution conference, Jan. 23-25, 2018. It is also available for free download on West Monroe\u0026rsquo;s website.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nSuccessful grid modernization requires strengthened organizational structures and change management \u0026ndash; yet the survey results point to gaps in culture, priorities, and expectations between C-suite executives motivated to move their organizations into the future and managers focused on current operations.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u0026ldquo;It is not unusual for large organizations to experience a disconnect between the C-suite and managers. This is especially true for large investor-owned utilities that are grappling with distinct organizations spread across a large geographical area or even across multiple states,\u0026rdquo; said Daniel Belmont, senior director in West Monroe\u0027s Energy \u0026amp; Utilities practice. \u0026ldquo;To make meaningful progress with grid modernization, utility executives must be aware of this gap and, more importantly, understand how to close it.\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe survey also explored concerns that may be limiting progress around IT/OT integration. Among the various issues studied \u0026ndash; which ranged from governance of devices and systems to retraining staff \u0026ndash; cybersecurity was far and away the leading concern and a key reason utilities are moving cautiously on technology integration. Two-thirds of respondents cited cybersecurity systems and devices as a top concern for managing converged IT/OT systems. Moreover, a majority (55 percent) said cybersecurity/NERC-CIP was the top skill or certification lacking in their workforce.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u0026ldquo;In addition to the usual headaches accompanying a service disruption, a cyber-attack carries significant reputational risks, which may prompt heightened caution from leadership at investor-owned utilities,\u0026rdquo; said Jodi Bednar, senior principal in the Energy \u0026amp; Utilities practice. \u0026ldquo;From our perspective, utilities are working on this issue, and the survey shows that they are acutely aware of the importance \u0026ndash; but also the challenge \u0026ndash; of bolstering cybersecurity skills.\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe survey report also allows utility executives to compare their own progress in other areas critical to advancing grid modernization, including:\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThe degree to which IT and operational teams share asset management, knowledge management, and ticketing systems\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eCurrent use of IT frameworks (including ITIL, COBIT, FCAPS, or eTOM) for managing the complexity associated with coordinating IT and OT operations\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ePrevalence of a \u0026ldquo;single pane of glass\u0026rdquo; to monitor and manage grid health\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nSurvey author Daniel Belmont is on-site at DistribuTECH discussing the survey results with utility executives and other attendees.

But with DOE\u0026rsquo;s depth and breadth of skills and technical capabilities with energy resources, it too could leverage such opportunities and play a major role in forging private-public partnerships in land development serving the national interest.

The analyses themselves were constrained by limited data and budgets. To the extent that site-specific information was developed for the highest-scoring sites, the analysis provided insights on the energy resource types that have potential to be developed at those sites. Overall, the analyses did not settle the question of which sites have the greatest potential or which additional sites can be cost-effectively developed, the report says.\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe report concludes that the use of Levelized Cost of Electricity as the main determinant of the potential for energy resource development on DOE lands \u0026ndash; as the NREL portion of the analyses did -- is a flawed approach. Site-specific analyses for individual technologies and resources are needed, because the unique circumstances of each individual project will determine an investor\u0026rsquo;s decision to develop the project. The NREL analysis does identify sites for development and provides an indication of the resource(s) that might have development potential, but with limited confidence, the report notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe report recommends that DOE develop an accurate and actionable inventory of properties that can be leased or sold for energy development.

In a second phase, DOE should put in place the administrative procedures needed to make these lands available to developers and for generating revenue, modeled after the method used by the Department of the Interior. Third, DOE should use the information gathered during prior phases to improve its estimates of the costs and benefits of developing its properties for energy projects and should conduct use-cases for select projects. And finally, having identified the properties with the most promising cost-benefit profiles, DOE should solicit commercial input to begin actual development of energy projects on the properties. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe report also offers observations and recommendations about specific energy sources, including the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSolar.\u003c/strong\u003e The analytical results presented in the NREL analysis for solar are not a fair representation of potential resource development on DOE sites, the report says; the value of solar is potentially underrepresented in the Levelized Cost of Electricity.

Connect-the-Grid is a Distributed Energy Resource Management (DERMS) tool targeted at helping utilities improve the process of enrolling new distributed generation systems (e.g. rooftop solar) and managing them once they are on-line.\u0026nbsp;CTG dramatically reduces enrollment times and provides insight into the impact distributed generation has on the distribution grid. With the rapid growth of interconnection requests, utilities need tools that allow them to respond quickly while also ensuring that they are not compromising reliability or power quality. Today, most utilities are tasked with manual processes and time consuming analysis due to gathering information from multiple systems for each application--and often, utilities do not have the necessary tools to automate the technical screening of new applications.\u0026nbsp; Automating the enrollment process, creating a central repository for data, and having a platform to visualize grid impacts of new and existing DG assets make up the heart of Connect the Grid. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinalists\u0026rsquo; applications were reviewed by an exclusive panel of executives from major North American utilities including CenterPoint Energy, Commonwealth Edison, Duke Energy, Florida Power \u0026amp; Light, National Grid, Pacific Gas \u0026amp; Electric Company, Portland General Electric, and San Diego Gas \u0026amp; Electric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll applications were evaluated based on the following criteria: technology innovation, financial impact, market validation, compatibility with existing networks, end-user customer experience, and overall level of innovation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Connect-the-Grid eases several utility pain points associated with distributed generation,\u0026rdquo; said Tom Hulsebosch, managing director of the Energy \u0026amp; Utility practice. \u0026ldquo;Utilities are under pressure from both customers and regulatory bodies to move faster. Connect-the-Grid reduces the time it takes to manage the application process and builds a database of all distributed generation on each feeder. Once systems are enrolled, Connect-the-Grid helps automate the technical evaluation of new applications for quicker acceptance or identification of potential issues.\u0026nbsp;Distribution Engineers are able to see the impact of the actual output each system is producing on an individual or aggregate basis. The visualization of actual system generation and comparing it to the feeder peak and minimum loads over time makes CTG an extremely powerful tool.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor more information about Connect-the-Grid, visit our\u0026nbsp;webpage.

Survey data presented in the report shows that corporations and private equity (PE) firms have accumulated vast amounts of cash and are planning to target firms specializing in industry-specific software, business intelligence, and cloud computing. These buyers are looking more closely at firms with an emphasis on finding the right target instead of price. This translates to deals moving faster than ever, with limited time for buyers to conduct due diligence and detect potential post-deal issues involving \u003ca href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=1BD1BAEF2079416E8FF6CCF14CF0B86F\u0026amp;_z=z\"\u003ecybersecurity\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs \u003ca href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=5DD528D781B44014946829319E06AE96\u0026amp;_z=z\"\u003eMatt Sondag\u003c/a\u003e, Managing Director of Mergers and Acquisitions for West Monroe Partners, says, \u0026ldquo;You have more funds in existence today and some of the larger funds are coming down market, especially for software assets.

Though consumers seem positive about greener delivery, the study found that North American consumers are mostly unaware such delivery options exist. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u0026ldquo;The modern consumer is paying more than lip service to environmentally-conscious decisions these days, and plenty are willing to put their money \u0026ndash; and patience \u0026ndash; where their mouths are\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Given the dominance of ecommerce and trends such as same and next-day delivery, order fulfillment\u0026rsquo;s impact on the environment is a significant one,\u0026rdquo; said Yves Leclerc, managing director and leader of West Monroe\u0026rsquo;s supply chain practice. \u0026ldquo;Consumers are willing to sacrifice for products delivered in ways that don\u0026rsquo;t yield damaging greenhouse gas emissions \u0026ndash; they just need to be aware of these alternative delivery models first.\u0026rdquo; \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nIn its Need for Green or Need for Speed study, West Monroe surveyed more than 600 U.S. consumers to determine what compromises they\u0026rsquo;d be willing to make for more sustainable delivery of products purchased online. Highlights from the study include:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e12% of US consumers would pay up to 10% more for sustainable delivery.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eAnnual income was not an influential factor in consumers\u0026rsquo; willingness to pay more for sustainable delivery. In fact, respondents who earn over $100,000 a year were slightly less likely to accept higher prices for climate-friendly transport.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eSimilarly, age had only a minor impact on attitudes toward sustainability, with 18-25 year olds slightly less likely to pay more for climate-friendly transport compared to 26-35 year olds.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the study does show that, if knowledgeable about the options available to them, many consumers would make at least minor concessions for more sustainable delivery. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nManagement and technology consultancy BearingPoint conducted the same study in Europe and found consumers there are more aware of green delivery options. Of the 1,000 European respondents BearingPoint surveyed, nearly half were aware of climate-friendly shipping alternatives and one in five has already used them. Almost 60 percent were willing to pay more for green shipping and 76% were willing to wait up to three days longer for sustainable delivery. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nE-commerce organizations therefore should consider new ways to promote delivery alternatives to please both consumers and shareholders. Firms should build sustainable processes into their supply chains and use tools to track and report on progress. West Monroe and BearingPoint\u0026rsquo;s Logistics Emissions Calculator (LogEC) tool provides companies with detailed calculations and analyses regarding the environmental impact of their transportation while providing specialized optimization potentials. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u0026ldquo;The modern consumer is paying more than lip service to environmentally-conscious decisions these days, and plenty are willing to put their money \u0026ndash; and patience \u0026ndash; where their mouths are,\u0026rdquo; said Leclerc. \u0026ldquo;E-commerce shops and logistics providers offering options such as flexible delivery windows and transportation modes will miss out on a major opportunity unless they put more effort into educating their customers. In addition, companies that don\u0026rsquo;t implement sustainable delivery practices now expose themselves to shareholder and customer risk as legislation may continue to put limits on a company\u0026rsquo;s carbon emissions.\u0026rdquo; \u003c/p\u003e"

Yet, both employers and employees detect a sizable skills deficit. More than half \u0026ndash; 56 percent \u0026ndash; of organizations believe they have a moderate to severe skills gap today, and 60 percent of employees believe that, to some extent, their current skill set will become outdated in the next three to five years.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese are among the key findings in a new report, \u003ca href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=6D05DC638AF34C1B89670BA0EA5BB4B1\u0026amp;_z=z\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;The Upskilling Crisis: Effectively Enabling and Retraining Employees for the Future,\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;released today by West Monroe Partners, a business and technology consultancy.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u0026ldquo;The urgency for upskilling comes at a time when emerging skill sets are scarce and the talent market is tight \u0026ndash; making it prudent to keep people even if they don\u0026rsquo;t have the right skills right now,\u0026rdquo; said Michael Hughes, managing director and leader of West Monroe\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=2C09FA607F05454A844E38C7F15C6360\u0026amp;_z=z\"\u003eOperations Excellence\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;practice. \u0026ldquo;Indeed, it\u0026rsquo;s often cheaper to retrain current employees than find and hire new ones, as the consequences of turnover can be felt at the bottom line.\u0026rdquo;\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nIn the past year, 70 percent of organizations have introduced at least one new technology designed to increase employee capacity. Employers and employees agree these employee-enablement tools create value. Among employers, 78 percent say enablement technology makes the organization more efficient, and 71 percent say it increases productivity. Sixty-one percent of employees believe technology helps them deliver a higher quality of work output, while 56 percent agree that it allows them to work more efficiently and frees time for additional tasks.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nEnabling managers will be key to addressing technology adoption, disruption, and upskilling challenges. Many organizations, however, are missing the mark, as 63 percent have not equipped managers with upskilling resources. Sixty-five percent of those surveyed feel the people responsible for leading the way during change \u0026ndash; managers and senior leaders \u0026ndash; need upskilling and reskilling, themselves. Furthermore, 43 percent believe managers don\u0026rsquo;t know how to upskills and reskill employees, and another 39 percent feel they don\u0026rsquo;t have the time to do so.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The survey results strongly support the need for significant investment in manager development and enablement if organizations are to realize the impact of digital transformation on the bottom line,\u0026rdquo; said Hughes. \u0026ldquo;The results also point to the importance of human-centered design in their approach to upskilling. Before implementing any sort of enablement technology, organizations need to consider the employee journey and how the selected tool(s) will add value \u0026ndash; but only 16 percent of those surveyed do so consistently.\u0026rdquo;\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nWest Monroe partnered with the Human Capital Media Research and Advisory Group, the research arm of Human Capital Media, to conduct a pair of surveys on employer and employee attitudes toward upskilling and employee enablement technologies.

The main premise of situational awareness is to center decision-making (and action-taking) on a specific situation with the use of data available to organizations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe article explores the theory and includes a Q\u0026amp;A with Chicago\u0026rsquo;s former CIO, Brett Goldstein, to uncover best practices. Goldstein gives insights on how they used situational awareness to improve decision making in the city. The interview explains how situational awareness can incorporate data analytics into the \u0026lsquo;business as usual\u0026rsquo; of running a city like Chicago, driving significant improvements to decision-making and service delivery. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nAdditionally the BearingPoint Institute looks into new market trends: as governments and banks exit the large-scale infrastructure funding sector, authors investigate if institutional investors such as insurers will bridge the funding gap.

The study found the interest and growth of DERs is increasing among residential customers particularly, but some utility executives and regulators have yet to settle on collaborative ways to prepare for the potential shift. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommercial and industrial customers have long led the charge for self-generation technologies; however, the tide is changing as residential customers increasingly look to adopt DERs in their homes and neighborhoods through shared resources such as community solar. According to West Monroe Partner\u0026rsquo;s study, residential customers are the largest group adding DERs as cited by 82 percent of utility executives, closely followed by commercial and industrial customers (77%). \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA combination of factors is impacting customers\u0026rsquo; interest in DERs, from the social benefits to their economic and reliability benefits. Of customers that have adopted renewable energy sources, 71 percent did so to lower their utility bill and 17 percent did in response to their stated environmental stewardship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;While DER adoption is beneficial for customers and the environment, it\u0026rsquo;s forcing the utility industry and regulators to reconsider the traditional utility business model and how the utility monetizes the value of the services it offers to customers,\u0026rdquo; said Tom Hulsebosch, managing director in West Monroe\u0026rsquo;s Energy \u0026amp; Utilities practice. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite residential customers\u0026rsquo; increased interest in DERs, only 37 percent of utility executives offer DER-specific support services, systems or technologies, and 59 percent plan to make no or minimal investments to support DERs unless mandated to do so. Utilities\u0027 inaction is attributed to the industry\u0027s lack of clarity around DERs\u0027 impact on their systems and regulatory uncertainties. The study found 66 percent of executives feel DERs are both a threat and opportunity for their businesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUtility executives hold a conservative outlook toward the spread of distributed energy resources within their systems. Sixty-eight percent of executives expect DER technologies to only provide 1 to 5 percent of supply resources in the next five years, and 47 percent believe small residential systems will be the most prevalent source of DERs on their systems in the next five years, followed by third-party power providers, the utility itself, and commercial/industrial systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompared to utility executives, regulators are already modifying their requirements and compliance requirements to support DER integration. Regulators cite a handful of concerns driving the proposed changes. Grid reliability was ranked by regulators as the top factor driving regulatory action to support DERs with 78 percent, followed by rising costs of delivered energy and requests from external stakeholders with 67 percent. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSupporting DERs and integrating them into daily utility operations will not come without challenges. According to the study, 61 percent of utility executives believe capital and financial constraints are barriers to DER adoption and support, while 61 percent of regulators believe regulatory barriers are the most significant obstacles. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Utility executives and regulators have contrasting views on the amount of DER penetration that can be readily absorbed into the existing grid without fundamental changes being made to accommodate them,\u0026rdquo; said Paul A. DeCotis, director in West Monroe\u0026rsquo;s Energy \u0026amp; Utilities practice and East Coast lead. \u0026ldquo;This divide, along with technology availability and cost, pivoting business models and public policy interests, have put a hold on the amount of DER integration expected to come on line in the immediate future. These and other issues continue to impede the industry\u0026rsquo;s ability to accommodate new energy technologies and gain greater support, DeCotis said.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEducating customers on these new technologies is another barrier to DER adoption. The study found 69 percent of customers do not know if their utility offers DERs enrollment and 94 percent say their providers haven\u0026rsquo;t approached them about alternative energy options. Utilities that fail to educate customers and provide a sufficient DER customer experience may suffer business and compliance consequences, and as a result, more oversight from regulators. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA copy of the full survey results can be found \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://www.westmonroe.com/Insights/White-Papers/Distributed-Energy-Resources\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e"

We come together every day with the purpose of building a thriving organization, but let\u0026rsquo;s face it: There is a big world beyond the walls of West Monroe Partners. We share a passion and commitment for making that world a better place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWest Monroe Partners, a North American business and technology consulting firm, today announced that, through the efforts of its over 300 employees in seven offices in the United States and Canada, it donated more than 2,200 hours of pro-bono services in 2011 to projects that promote positive changes in its communities. Examples of these projects include equipping the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle to achieve its conservation and sustainability goals and developing new frameworks to support the City of Chicago\u0026rsquo;s Climate Action Plan. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese are among the early accomplishments of an ambitious new social and environmental responsibility commitment announced in early 2011. Following on the leadership efforts of its clients and business partners, West Monroe Partners set annual goals to contribute one percent of its talent in pro-bono work, one percent of its profits in donations to qualifying organizations, and one percent of its collective personnel time to community engagement and leadership activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Being stewards of our environment and the world is important to our people and, indeed, many of us have embraced this responsibility for years. A little over a year ago, we made the first significant change to our enterprise values in our almost 10 years of existence by adding a defined value around social responsibility,\u0026rdquo; said Dean Fischer, West Monroe Partners\u0026rsquo; president and CEO. \u0026ldquo;We recognize that this is a very ambitious commitment, and we have a long way to go to achieve our goals, but we are proud of how our people have embraced this social commitment and opportunity. By maintaining and refining this commitment year over year, we can elevate the impact of our collective activities and help lead the important changes that need to happen in our communities.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow in the second year of this program, the firm continues to see an increase in employee involvement. For example, employees in Chicago are participating in a city sponsored initiative to clean the Chicago River; employees in Canada are investing time and resources to improve facilities and set up computers and computer training for Auberge Madeleine, a community homeless shelter; and employees in Columbus are providing business expertise to support the Future Cities Competition State Finals, a national, project-based learning experience for middle-school students.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nIn addition, firm personnel have supplemented pro-bono community time by spending at least as many hours on internal practices to reduce waste and energy consumption. For example, the Chicago office has committed to more than a dozen green improvements through its involvement with Chicago\u0026rsquo;s Green Office Challenge, as it designs, builds, and prepares to move into its new LEED-certified office space in Chicago. Through a Renewable Energy Credit program, the firm also has committed to procurement of 100-percent renewable energy in 2012 and 2013 to power all offices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2011, West Monroe Partners also matched nearly 500 hours of time spent by employees on qualified community service activities so that employees could devote additional hours to these pursuits while on the job. The firm also contributed more than $100,000 to community organizations across its six markets.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 sizcache=\"2\" sizset=\"64\"\u003eAbout West Monroe Partners\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp sizcache=\"2\" sizset=\"64\"\u003eWest Monroe Partners is a North American, full-service business and technology consulting firm focused on guiding organizations through projects that fundamentally transform their business.

As part of a consortium that also included the Civic Consulting Alliance, City of Chicago, Chicago Park District, IIT Galvin Center for Electricity Innovation, Illinois Science \u0026amp; Technology Coalition, and the Citizens Utility Board, West Monroe Partners played a key leading role in the development of the strategic Master Energy Roadmap for the institution. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nShedd Aquarium, a leading global conservation and education organization, aims to cut energy consumption of the 83-year-old historic building in half by 2020, saving 10 million kilowatt hours annually\u0026mdash;enough to power 750 households. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nDevelopment of the project roadmap, which completed the first phase of the long-term initiative, produced an assessment of the institution\u0026rsquo;s current energy profile, evaluated 24 specific areas of opportunity, and created a comprehensive structure and process for management and implementation. Key findings identified include the use of real-time and consumption-point data intelligence to optimize operational and equipment energy use, as well as significant tools and technologies that could potentially decrease energy consumption, just to name a few. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u0026ldquo;We are pleased to have this opportunity to contribute some of West Monroe Partners\u0026rsquo; core skills and our time\u0026mdash;not only to benefit one of Chicago\u0026rsquo;s most iconic cultural institutions, but also to promote the development and benefit of strategies that have a meaningful impact on our environment and our community,\u0026rdquo; said Tom Hulsebosch, director of West Monroe\u0026rsquo;s Utility and Smart Energy practice. \u0026ldquo;The output of this work provides Shedd Aquarium with clear direction for advancing its goals.\u0026rdquo; \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nOther elements of the Master Energy Roadmap include advanced intelligence, energy efficiency, automation and control, energy storage, and on-site renewable generation.

These services balance a need for investing in infrastructure while supporting increased customer service expectations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo assist water utilities with increasing customer demands, bad debt, water leakage, an aging infrastructure and workforce, and billing inaccuracy issues, West Monroe Partners has developed an offering that helps water utilities tackle these challenges. West Monroe Partners works with water utilities to optimize processes, identify the right technologies, and position its workforce to leverage the new technology and processes. A key component of West Monroe\u0026rsquo;s methodology is creating a culture of measurement and continuous improvement. West Monroe Partners has found that identifying key performance indicators for processes such as customer payment delinquency rates or number of billing exceptions--along with goals for improvement bring the necessary focus, employee engagement, and accountability to enable sustainable improvements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWest Monroe Partners is currently helping multiple water utilities address these challenges while they transform their organizations. These transformations start with a strategic plan that includes the business case, approach, technology roadmap, and identifies the organizational impacts the utility will face. The results of many of these projects address key issues, improve service levels, reduce bad debt and improve employee engagement for clients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Transformation is something that every utility should be thinking about right now. Evolving expectations have placed a high demand on customer experience and meter operations but utilities are struggling to keep up \u0026ndash; both financially and operationally. Many utilities aren\u0026rsquo;t sure how to tackle this problem, but we believe that creating a strategic customer service transformation plan is an important initial step. In addition to a strong ROI, we believe that offering a great customer experience is necessary to meet today\u0026rsquo;s challenging customer expectations. We are excited for what the future holds for this market and look forward to helping our utility clients achieve their strategic vision,\u0026rdquo; said Tom Hulsebosch, managing director of West Monroe\u0026rsquo;s Energy \u0026amp; Utilities Practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWest Monroe has completed a benchmark study on credit \u0026amp; collection practices of electric and water utilities by surveying many different utility types and sizes. This study has culminated in a collection of credit \u0026amp; collection best practices that utilities can use to reduce risk, enhance revenue protection, and improve the overall customer experience.

West Monroe Partners ranked third overall, jumping four spots from seventh overall in 2014.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nWest Monroe Partners also ranked among the top 10 firms in six out of six employee satisfaction categories: firm culture, work/life balance, compensation and benefits, client engagement, career development and leadership. West Monroe Partners, along with all recognized consultancies, is profiled in the \u0026ldquo;Best Firms to Work For\u0026rdquo; special section of the Consulting\u0026reg; September issue.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u0026ldquo;To receive recognition as a top workplace is always gratifying; it validates the diligence we put into building and nurturing our culture and 100-percent employee ownership model,\u0026rdquo; said Kevin McCarty, West Monroe Partners\u0026rsquo; president and CEO. \u0026ldquo;When you have a true culture of empowerment, it translates to high engagement and stewardship. Everyone here feels it\u0026rsquo;s his or her job to nurture and preserve our culture\u0026mdash;and that manifests itself in everything from our workplace to the quality of the work we deliver.\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nWest Monroe Partners\u0026rsquo; innovative \u0026ldquo;people-first\u0026rdquo; culture and practices include a highly collaborative and participatory environment in which people at all levels contribute to the company\u0026rsquo;s direction and share in its results. Because of its size and predominantly middle-market client base, consultants have opportunities to assume significant client service and internal team responsibilities early in their careers. Reflective of its commitment to 100-percent employee ownership, the firm converted to an ESOP at the end of 2012. All employees participate in the plan, which rewards loyalty, professional growth, and company performance.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u0026ldquo;We are particularly pleased to be recognized in the area of compensation and benefits for the first time,\u0026rdquo; said McCarty. \u0026ldquo;That reflects years of strategically building a very compelling total reward package that exemplifies our employee-owned culture. Market-competitive salary and benefits are of course a foundation. But when you add to those our profit-sharing bonus and ESOP contribution, both of which have been very healthy the past two years, it\u0026rsquo;s really not surprising to me that we are now receiving recognition in this area.\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nWest Monroe Partners has received numerous accolades for its workplace and human resource practices. In addition to recognition from Consulting\u0026reg; magazine, the firm has been recognized nationally by Great Place To Work\u0026reg; and Vault.com and regionally in several key markets, including Chicago, Seattle, Minneapolis, and Columbus, Ohio.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e"

Winning a spot on this list indicates the company has distinguished itself from peers by creating a great place to work for all \u0026ndash; not only do the majority of their employees experience the company as a great place to work, but this experience is consistent across the organization, regardless of gender, race/ethnicity, job role, or other personal characteristics. The companies with the highest employee ratings compared with organizations of the same complexity in size and scope were selected for the list. Companies with fewer than 100 employees compete for placement on the 50 Best Small Workplaces list, and companies between 100 and 999 employees compete for placement on the 100 Best Medium Workplaces list.\u003c/p\u003e"

The list, a collaboration of Forbes and online statistics provider Statista published by Forbes on April 20, 2016, recognizes more than 250 management consultancies recommended by consulting executives and validated by clients as the best firms in 15 industries and 16 functional areas. West Monroe Partners appeared on the list of best firms in five functional areas: Digital Transformation, IT Implementation, IT Strategy, Mergers and Acquisitions, and Operations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;We are proud to be recognized among the leaders in our profession, and especially in areas that are so critical to success today\u0026rsquo;s business environment such as mergers and acquisitions, IT strategy, and digital transformation,\u0026rdquo; said Kevin McCarty, West Monroe Partners\u0026rsquo; CEO and co-founder. \u0026ldquo;It is particularly gratifying that our presence on among the profession\u0026rsquo;s best is based on input from our clients\u0026mdash;evidence that we have been successful in fielding the right blend of business consulting savvy and deep technology expertise to help them navigate through complex challenges and transform successfully to compete in evolving markets. \u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFounded in 2002 in Chicago, West Monroe Partners has grown to 12 offices across the United States and more than 700 consultants.

First, they asked more than 7,000 consulting firm partners and executives to recommend firms (excluding their own) across the 15 industries and 16 functional areas. From this survey, they created lists of consultancies for each industry and functional area and then asked more than 1,300 client senior executives to recommend consultancies on lists for industries and functional areas in which they had worked with a consultancy in the past four years. Firms received up to five stars based on the numbers of mentions from consultants and clients; those earning three, four, or five stars within a particular industry or functional area were included on the final list of best firms for that area. The study did not produce an overall ranking of firms across industries and functional areas.\u003c/p\u003e"

The publication surveyed more than 230 businesses in the region, ultimately honoring 85 finalists\u0026mdash;25 each in the small, medium, and large business categories, and 10 in the extra-large business category.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eOpened in 2005, the Seattle office today has more than 40 employees and serves more than 20 active clients across the Pacific Northwest, including some of Washington\u0026rsquo;s other \u0026ldquo;Best Workplaces\u0026rdquo;. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;West Monroe Partners is built on a foundation of people-focused core values,\u0026rdquo; said Tom Bolger, who has led the Seattle practice since its inception. \u0026ldquo;We believe that focusing on the type of environment and experiences we offer our people translates directly into the quality of service we deliver to our clients. That philosophy is responsible for the growth and success we have enjoyed in the Pacific Northwest.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eLike all West Monroe Partners offices, the Seattle practice maintains a highly participatory and collaborative culture marked by an open work environment; frequent employee meetings and gatherings, including an annual retreat at Leavenworth to celebrate Oktoberfest; a strong commitment to serving the local community by hosting firm-sponsored community service events; and regular recognition of its employees. The company has rigorously maintained this culture as it has grown to seven offices across North America and a team of more than 300 consultants\u0026mdash;in part by remaining 100-percent employee owned. Its commitment to a people-first culture enables people at all levels to contribute to the company\u0026rsquo;s direction and share in its results.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not the first local or national recognition for West Monroe Partners. Seattle Business Magazine has included the firm on its list of \u0026ldquo;Best Companies to Work For\u0026mdash;Headquartered Outside of Washington\u0026rdquo; for the past two years. Additionally, in 2008, Seattle Business Monthly named West Monroe Partners one of Seattle\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Best Places to Work.\u0026rdquo; Recognition like this is not just specific to the Seattle market; West Monroe has institutionalized a people-first oriented culture firm-wide, which has led to national recognition for its workplace by Consulting Magazine and Vault.com as well as multiple local awards in Chicago and Columbus. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe Puget Sound Business Journal asked readers to nominate their own or other companies beginning in March.

With this research, we are able to conduct conversations with organizations about what specifically they can do to see direct impact on their revenue and profits.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWest Monroe conducted the online survey with 407 executives based in the United States to understand perspectives on digital maturity and the impact of employing digital initiatives across four industries: healthcare, financial services, energy and utilities, and manufacturing (specifically consumer and industrial products). Respondents were divided among C-level executives and senior managers with decision-making influence for digital investment. Survey respondents self-assessed their organizations on 16 components of digital maturity. Supplementary qualitative interviews were conducted with 10 senior executives in support of the quantitative research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe survey found digital maturity levels are fairly evenly divided across the spectrum from \u0026ldquo;not digitally mature\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;very digitally mature,\u0026rdquo; with the largest percentage of companies \u0026ndash; 21.5 percent \u0026ndash; characterizing themselves as average. Some industries are farther along in the digital journey: Almost half (47 percent) of financial services organizations consider themselves to be digitally mature or very mature, as opposed to only 31 percent of healthcare organizations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross all industries, half of companies are investing to digitize their operating model. The most digitally mature companies spend 35 percent of overall budget on digital initiatives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;When thinking about investment, consider that three of the four elements that most correlated with financial performance explicitly cite customers,\u0026rdquo; said Greg Layok, managing director and leader of West Monroe\u0026rsquo;s Technology practice. \u0026ldquo;Time and time again, we see a customer-focused mindset ensure that digital transformation isn\u0026rsquo;t simply about \u0026lsquo;technology for technology\u0026rsquo;s sake.\u0026rsquo; Instead, it makes digital tangible, actionable, and most importantly, profitable.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther key findings of the report, which illustrates practical, real-world examples of digital in action, include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eMost companies have work to do to establish a clear digital vision.

Eighty percent of consumers who have communicated real-time with their healthcare provider via a mobile app prefer this method over a traditional office visit, according to new research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe study highlights how consumer preferences are shifting away from traditional office visits, toward more digital, mobile interactions. These changing habits are especially apparent among younger, tech-native consumers who view their healthcare experience as more than an annual checkup, but rather an ongoing, digitally connected relationship with their providers. However, healthcare providers and insurers are not prepared to meet these evolving needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Healthcare providers realize the impact of digital communication channels and are beginning to adapt,\u0026rdquo; said Will Hinde, senior director at West Monroe Partners and leader of the firm\u0026rsquo;s Healthcare practice. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re starting to see more providers incorporate the digital experience with their office visit, by shifting to more online scheduling of appointments, paperless office interactions, following up via email, portals, and mobile apps, and taking steps towards greater cost and quality transparency.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsumers are overwhelmingly gravitating toward digital channels like online portals and mobile apps to connect with their healthcare providers when offered. According to the study, 86 percent of consumers who have access to online portals use them for some or all of their communication with their healthcare provider, while 91 percent use mobile apps when they are available. In addition, nearly one-third (31%) of consumers have used a mobile application to communicate with their healthcare provider in real time about a specific condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile consumers\u0026rsquo; expectations of the healthcare experience are rapidly changing, healthcare executives don\u0026rsquo;t feel prepared to meet their needs. According to the study, 85 percent of healthcare insurance executives aren\u0026rsquo;t confident they have the right technology in place to evolve the customer experience to meet consumer expectations and 54 percent aren\u0026rsquo;t confident they have the processes needed to evolve that experience. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHealthcare insurance executives are also challenged by consumers\u0026rsquo; reluctance to share personal data with them. Given the volume, scale and visibility of healthcare-based cyberattacks over the past few years, less than half of consumers (48%) completely trust their provider with their personal information. In many instances, consumers are willing to overcome their privacy concerns if rewarded with better rates and a higher quality of service. However, only eight percent of healthcare insurers offer discounted rates in exchange for participation, while none offer direct discounts on products or services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca name=\"_gjdgxs\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\"Health insurers should take cues from the retail and banking industries,\u0026rdquo; said Kyle Hutchins, senior director of Customer Experience at West Monroe Partners. \u0026ldquo;From booking an appointment to receiving an explanation of benefits, healthcare organizations wanting to keep up with today\u0026rsquo;s pace of change must have an agile operating model.

New research confirms rapid deployment: 92 percent of electric utilities say they have DERs on their system, up from 80 percent three years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, more than 40 percent of utilities see DERs as an opportunity, up from 31 percent previously. Yet, this said, 80 percent of customers report that their utility has not yet approached them with any alternative energy options, suggesting many utilities have not yet fully seized the opportunity or regulators have not given them direction or incentives to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese are among the key findings in a new report, \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=5FFEC53BFE7A43C9B637018A5F1B16DD\u0026amp;_z=z\"\u003ePlanning for a Distributed Energy Future\u003c/a\u003e,\u0026rdquo; released today by West Monroe Partners, a national business and technology consultancy. The research is a follow-up to West Monroe\u0026rsquo;s 2016 study, \u0026ldquo;Keeping the Lights On,\u0026rdquo; which revealed that while utilities and regulators understood that customer interest in DERs was significant and rising, the actual adoption was still limited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;This year\u0026rsquo;s survey confirms that utilities are taking actions necessary to accommodate increasing penetrations of DERs resources on the grid, yet those actions are not at the rate required to keep ahead of customers\u0026rsquo; demand and regulators\u0026rsquo; expectations,\u0026rdquo; said\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=293994505D8745CFAC1DDD20363A21EE\u0026amp;_z=z\"\u003ePaul DeCotis\u003c/a\u003e, senior director in West Monroe\u0026rsquo;s Energy \u0026amp; Utilities practice and lead author of the study.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u0026ldquo;The survey results suggest that no matter what DER penetration is today, the next few years will be extremely important.

The research goal was to revisit customer attitudes toward DER adoption, the ongoing impacts DERs are having on utility operations in the United States, and what both utilities and regulatory bodies are doing (or plan to do) to accommodate increasing customer demands for DERs from strategy through process and technology needs and system integration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore than 90 percent of utilities said DERs were having some impact on their operations or revenue, yet nearly 60 percent said they had no specific management services available for DERs. This highlights the mismatch between the proliferation of DERs connecting to the grid and the near-term planning necessary to accommodate them in novel ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Failure to be proactive exposes utilities to risk,\u0026rdquo; said DeCotis. \u0026ldquo;By not developing systems and processes needed to accommodate growing demand for distributed energy resources, utilities take the risk that large and small customers may bypass the utility grid in favor of self-generation with or without utility back-up service. Customers bypassing the utility altogether is a threat from new large loads interested in contracting with third parties to provide electric service directly onsite.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther key findings of the report include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e15 percent of customers said they have renewable energy resources powering their homes.

A majority of customers, 60 percent, said solar is the renewable energy supplying power to their homes.\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eWhile residential customers are still seen as driving most of the demand, 66 percent of utilities said third parties (other than customers) were adding DERs, up from 32 percent in the previous survey. Nearly 30 percent of utilities said aggregated communities are adding DERs to their system today, up from 12 percent three years ago. Depending on the regulatory construct, these entities can compete with the utility.\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e40 percent of regulators are now looking at performance-based ratemaking, up from 25 percent three years ago.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA full copy of the report is available\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=5FFEC53BFE7A43C9B637018A5F1B16DD\u0026amp;_z=z\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"\u003eAbout West Monroe Partners\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nWest Monroe is a national business and technology consulting firm that partners with dynamic organizations to reimagine, build, and operate their businesses at peak performance.

Prior to KEMA, Mr. McNamara served as Regulatory and Legislative Policy Manager for Sempra Energy, where he developed the corporate policy response to energy-related matters before the California Public Utilities Commission, the California Legislature and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

West Monroe has been active in the regulatory space through the preparation of AMI / Smart Grid business cases for utility clients and their key stakeholders, including public utility commissions, utility advisory boards, and city councils. The maturing of the AMI / Smart Grid industry is driving needs within utilities for regulatory and key stakeholder services, including operational \u0026amp; performance benchmarking analysis; regulatory compliance assistance; expert testimony in regulatory proceedings; mobilizing community and key stakeholder support for AMI / Smart Grid utility projects; internal management alignment within client organizations; and expanded services associated with federal and state grant opportunities for utilities, an area in which West Monroe is already well established.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Will McNamara adds a significant regulatory, community-relations, and key stakeholder management capability to West Monroe\u0026rsquo;s Energy \u0026amp; Utilities practice, as well as substantial hands-on experience guiding utility clients through the many regulatory and public-relations challenges that are becoming such a prominent consideration for Smart Grid deployments,\u0026rdquo; said Tom Hulsebosch, managing director of West Monroe Partner\u0026rsquo;s E\u0026amp;U practice. \u0026ldquo;We believe that our Regulatory and Key Stakeholder service offering will be valuable to public power, cooperative, and investor owned utilities alike.

This is a particular concern among smaller and mid-sized utilities that are still formulating their initial deployment strategies.

Now in its fourth year, Workforce 100 designates companies as the best in HR management through statistical analysis conducted by Human Capital Media Advisory Group. West Monroe ranked No. 31 in its first time on the list.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe Workforce 100 chart indicates the rank order and scores of the 100 companies that performed best in seven core areas: workplace culture; employee benefits; diversity and inclusion; employee development/ talent management; HR innovation/management; leadership development; recruiting and talent acquisition. The working assumption is that high performance in these categories would provide a reasonable proxy for overall HR excellence.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nWest Monroe\u0026rsquo;s Chief People Officer Susan M. Stelter is pictured on the cover of the magazine and featured in the cover story about first-time companies on the list. In the article, she highlighted West Monroe\u0026rsquo;s people-first culture. \u0026ldquo;It is an honor to be ranked No. 31 out of the top 100 companies for best-in-class people practices,\u0026rdquo; Stelter said. \u0026ldquo;This is a testament to the passion and engagement of our 850-plus employee owners who make the firm a great place to work every day.\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nWest Monroe\u0026rsquo;s unique people practices include a 1+1+1 program where the firm donates 1% of its time, 1% of its talent, and 1% of its treasure to the greater good. Employees earn paid time off for each hour they volunteer through this program. The firm also supports employees\u0026rsquo; philanthropic and humanitarian interests with an extended three- to six-month compensated leave through the \u003ca href=\"https://www.acceptthechallenge.com/Values-and-Rewards/Doing-Good\"\u003eFischer Fellowship Program\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nTo find out which companies are the best for HR management, Workforce editors, along with researchers from the Human Capital Media Advisory Group, the magazine\u0026rsquo;s research arm, created a statistical formula to sift through publicly available information to separate the best from the rest. The result of that analysis is the Workforce 100 list.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re pleased this awards program continues to grow in popularity, but also in its ability to report organizations\u0026rsquo; performance with greater accuracy,\u0026rdquo; said Rick Bell, Workforce magazine\u0026rsquo;s editorial director. \u0026ldquo;Our rankings are compiled with tangible data backed by extensive research, and it continues to prove valuable in setting industry benchmarks.\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nWorkforce 100 honorees were announced on April 21, 2017 and West Monroe is profiled in the May/June issue of Workforce magazine.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMedia Contact:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nChristina Galoozis\u003cbr /\u003e\ncgaloozis@westmonroe.com\u003cbr /\u003e\n312.447.6623\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 style=\"margin-bottom: 5.25pt; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eAbout West Monroe\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp style=\"margin-bottom: 5.25pt; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eWest Monroe is a progressive business and technology consulting firm that partners with dynamic organizations to reimagine, build, and operate their businesses at peak performance.
